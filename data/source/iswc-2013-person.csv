,"Ramanathan V. Guha",,,,,Google,"United States",http://www.guha.com,"Ramanathan V. Guha is a Fellow at Google, heading initiatives such as Custom Search, Search based keyword tool, SMS Channels and Schema.org. He graduated with B.Tech (Mechanical Engineering) from Indian Institute of Technology Madras, MS from University of California Berkeley and Ph.D from Stanford University. Guha was one of the early co-leaders of the Cyc Project where he worked from 1987 through 1994 at Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation. Leaving what became Cycorp, Guha founded Q Technology, which created a database schema mapping tool called Babelfish. In 1994, he moved to work at Apple Computer, reporting to Alan Kay, where he developed the Meta Content Framework (MCF) format. In 1997 he joined Netscape Corporation where together with Tim Bray, he created a new version of MCF that used the XML language and which became the main technical precursor to W3C's Resource Description Framework (RDF) standard. Guha also contributed to the ""smart browsing"" features of Netscape 4.5 and was instrumental in Netscape's acquisition of the Open Directory Project. In March 1999, he created the first version of RSS as part of Netscape's personalized home page project. In 1999 he left Netscape and in May co-founded Epinions where he worked until 2000. Guha founded Alpiri in late 2000 which created TAP, a semantic web application and knowledge base. In 2002, he became a researcher at IBM Almaden Research Center.",,http://iswc2013.semanticweb.org/sites/all/themes/iswc/iswcdesktop/guha_big.png,,,,,http://iswc2013.semanticweb.org/content/keynote-ramanathan-v-guha,EOL
,"Peter Fox",,,,,RPI,"United States",http://tw.rpi.edu/web/person/PeterFox,"Peter Fox is Tetherless World Constellation Chair, Professor of Earth and Environmental Science and Computer Science, and Director of the Information Technology and Web Science Program at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Fox has a B.Sc. (hons) and Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics (physics and computer science) from Monash Univsersity. Previously, he spent 17 years at the High Altitude Observatory of the National Center for Atmospheric Research as Chief Computational Scientist. His research covers the fields of solar and solar-terrestrial physics, ocean and environmental informatics, computational and computer science, and distributed semantic data frameworks. The results are applied to large-scale distributed data science investigations. This research utilizes state-of-the-art modeling techniques, internet-based technologies, including the semantic web, and applies them to large-scale distributed scientific repositories addressing the full life-cycle of data and information within specific science and engineering disciplines as well as among disciplines. Fox is chair of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics Union Commission on Data and Information and serves on the editorial boards of many prominent Earth and space science informatics journals. Fox was awarded the 2012 European Geoscience Union, Ian McHarg/Earth and Space Science Informatics Medal and the Earth Science Information Partner's Martha Maiden Lifetime Achievement award for service to the Earth Sciences Information communities.",,http://iswc2013.semanticweb.org/sites/all/themes/iswc/iswcdesktop/fox_big.png,,,,,http://iswc2013.semanticweb.org/content/keynote-peter-fox,EOL
