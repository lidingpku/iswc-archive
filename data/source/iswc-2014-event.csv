Keyword-based search has become the de-facto standard for information discovery in this ocean of data, mainly due to its simplicity that makes it attractive to technically novice users. To answer keyword queries, existing search engines rely on effective indexes of the content that allow them to return the documents that best match the user’s search criteria. This generally leaves out the structure of the data, its semantic dimension, as well as the social aspects to which it may relate. We believe that, in order to exploit the full potential of the Web, structured and rich data will have to receive the same search and retrieve capabilities as the text data from Web documents. However, due to their highly structured nature, the rich semantics, and the data structures by which they are typically managed, a great deal of issues needs to be studied. As the problem is in general of a multifaceted nature, it requires synergies from many different disciplines. This workshop is jointly organized by the Working Groups 3 and 4 of the COST Action KEYSTONE, which is dedicated to launching and establishing a cooperative network of researchers, practitioners, and application domain specialists working in fields related to semantic data management, the Semantic Web, information retrieval, artificial intelligence, machine learning and natural language processing that coordinates collaboration among them to enable research activity and technology transfer in the area of keyword-based search over structured data sources.",http://sdsw-at-iswc2014.ipn.pt/,,,http://sdsw-at-iswc2014.ipn.pt/,EOL

The findings reported in these articles are often backed by large amounts of diverse data produced by complex experiments, computer simulations, and observations of physical phenomena. Although publications, methods and datasets are often related, due to this avalanche of data it remains extremely hard to correlate, reuse and leverage scientific data. Semantic Web technologies provide a promising means for publishing, sharing, and interlinking data to facilitate data reuse and the necessary correlation, integration, and synthesis of data across levels of theory, techniques and disciplines. However, even when these data become discoverable and accessible, significant challenges remain in making intelligent understandings of these data and scientific discoveries that we anticipated. Our past three series (LISC2011, LISC2012 and LISC2013) have seen many novel ideas of using Semantic Web technologies for integrating scientific data (for example about real experiments or from simulations), or enabling reproducibility of research via online tools and Linked Data. The theme for LISC2014 is “Making Sense out of Data Through Linked Science”. Here we focus on new ways of discovering interesting patterns from scientific data, which could lead to research validation or identification of new hypotheses and acceleration of the scientific research cycle. We encourage both new results through making use of semantic reasoning or making innovative combination of existing technologies (such as visualization, data mining, machine learning, and natural language processing) with SW technologies to enable better understanding of data. One goal is to create both an incentive for scientists to consider the Linked Science approach for their scientific data management and an incentive for technologists from different disciplines to work together towards the vision of powering science with technologies.",http://linkedscience.org/events/lisc2014/,,,http://linkedscience.org/events/lisc2014/,EOL

However, the exact criteria and tolerances will differ for each domain, requiring detailed knowledge about the data and its users. This also makes it very challenging to find generic solutions that are applicable everywhere. Therefore, stakeholders in this field are continuously investigating new techniques to handle and prepare data in such a way that it becomes easier for machines to process it with the goal of trust and/or quality assessment. The METHOD workshop will be a venue for presenting and discussing novel research ideas in this field, as well as technical applications.

On the other hand,  Linked Data provide billions of pieces of information linked together and made available for automated processing. However, there is the lack of interconnection between the information in the Web pages and Linked Data. A number of initiatives, like RDFa (supported by W3C) or Microformats (used by schema.org and supported by major search engines) are trying to enable machines to make sense of the information contained in human readable pages by providing the ability to annotate webpage content with Linked Data. This creates a large knowledge base of entities and concepts, connected by semantic relations. Such resources can be valuable seed data for IE tasks. Furthermore, the annotated web pages can be considered as training data in the traditional machine learning paradigm.  However, powering Web-scale IE using Linked Data faces major challenges, including  discovering relevant learning materials, which is non-trivial due to the heterogeneity of vocabularies, the imbalanced coverage of different domains and the presence of noise, errors, imprecision and spam.  Addressing these challenges requires multi-field collaborative research effort covering various topics such as modelling IE tasks with respect to LD; efficient, large scale, and robust learning algorithms able to scale and cope with noise; measures for assessing learning material quality, and methods for selecting and optimizing training seeds.",http://oak.dcs.shef.ac.uk/ld4ie2014,,,http://oak.dcs.shef.ac.uk/ld4ie2014,EOL

Stream and rank-aware data management techniques are progressively providing reactive and reliable query answering over such massive datasets. Key to their success is the use of streaming algorithms that harness the natural or enforceable orders in the data. Semantic technologies can play a relevant role in this setting, exploiting their expressive power to integrate those highly dynamic sources. In the recent years, different work started to push order-related concepts in semantic technologies, such as Stream Reasoning and top-k ontological query answering.

Many of these devices can act as sensors and there may be trillions of fixed sensors by 2020. Such sensors are geographically distributed and are capable of forming ad hoc networks, with nodes expected to be dynamically inserted and removed. This diverse, changing environment provides many interesting challenges. While frameworks such as the Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) standards, developed by the Open Geospatial Consortium, provide some interoperability, semantics is increasingly seen as a key enabler for integration of sensor data and broader Web information systems. Analytical and reasoning capabilities afforded by Semantic Web standards and technologies are considered important for developing advanced applications that go from capturing observations to recognition of events and ultimately developing comprehensive situational awareness. Defence, transportation, global enterprise, and natural resource management industries are leading the rapid emergence of applications in commercial, civic, and scientific operations that involve sensors, web services and semantics. Semantic technologies are often proposed as important components of complex, cross-jurisdictional, heterogeneous, dynamic information systems. The needs and opportunities arising from the rapidly growing capabilities of networked sensing devices are a challenging case. SSN 2014 aims to provide an inter-disciplinary forum to explore and promote the technologies related to a combination of the semantic web, sensor networking and sensors in the Internet of Things. Specifically, to develop an understanding of the ways semantic web technologies can contribute to the growth, application and deployment of large-scale sensor networks on the one hand, and the ways that sensor networks can contribute to the emerging semantic web, on the other.",http://knoesis.org/ssn2014/,,,http://knoesis.org/ssn2014/,EOL

In particular, the tutorial will tackle the following questions: How to represent rich multilingual lexical information (beyond rdfs:label) and associate it to ontologies and linked data? How to represent and publish multilingual texts, annotations and corpora as linked data? How to generate multilingual linked data from data silos? How to perform word sense disambiguation and entity linking of multilingual linked data? How to apply these techniques to a real use case? We will try to answer them in a practical way, by means of examples and hands-on exercises. The tutorial will be organised in five sections, each one covering one of such topics. Each section will be divided in a theoretical introduction and a practical session. The practical work will consist in completing some short guided examples proposed by the speakers.

Media annotation does take place within archives and repositories, but even the “semantic” annotation is typically disconnected from the web and its semantics layer. Linked Data-based annotation of media resources published on the Web could drive new applications for media retrieval and re-use, to the benefit of both media owners and consumers. This tutorial will look at tools and services to semantically annotate online media and use those annotations for online retrieval and re-use based on a number of emerging web specifications and technologies. We will focus on means to annotate spatial and temporal fragments of media assets with Linked Data concepts, how to use those annotations to discover types of relevancy between distinct media assets and development of applications using discovered links between annotated media to provide enhanced user services.",http://www.linkedtv.eu/event/tutorial/,,,http://www.linkedtv.eu/event/tutorial/,EOL

Early web search represented the adaptation of methods from classic Information Retrieval to the Web. Around the turn of this century, the focus shifted to triaging the need behind a query - whether it was Navigational, Informational or Transactional; engines began to customize their experiences depending on the need. The next change arose from the recognition that most queries embodied noun phrases, leading to the construction of knowledge representations from which queries could extract and deliver information regarding the noun in the query. Most recently, three trends represent the next step beyond these ""noun engines"": (1) ""Queryless engines"" have begun surfacing information meeting a user's need based on the user's context, without explicit querying; (2) Search engines have actively begun assisting the user's task at hand - the verb underlying the noun query; (3) increasing use of speech recognition is changing the distribution of queries.",http://iswc2014.semanticweb.org/keynote_prabhakar_raghavan,,,,EOL

We are investigating how semantics can help on both fronts. Our focus is scientific work, in particular data analysis, where tremendous potential resides in combining the knowledge and resources of a highly fragmented science community. We capture task knowledge in semantic workflows, and use skeletal plan refinement algorithms to assist users when they specify high-level tasks. But the formulation of workflows is in itself a collaborative activity, a kind of meta-workflow composed of tasks such as finding the data needed or designing a new algorithm to handle the data available. We are investigating ""organic data science"", a new approach to collaboration that allows scientists to formulate and resolve scientific tasks through an open framework that facilitates ad-hoc participation. With a design based on social computing principles, our approach makes scientific processes transparent and incorporates semantic representations of tasks and their properties. The semantic challenges involved in this work are numerous and have great potential to transform the Web to help us do work in more productive and unanticipated ways.",http://iswc2014.semanticweb.org/keynote_yolanda_gil,,,,EOL

In particular, governments have made data available across a wide range of sectors: spending, crime and justice, education, health, transport, geospatial, environmental and much more. The data has been published in a variety of formats and has been reused with varying degrees of success. Commercial organisations have begun to exploit this resource and in some cases elected to release their own open data. Only a relatively small amount of the data published has been linked data.  However, the methods and techniques of the semantic web could significantly enhance the value and utility of open data. What are the obstacles and challenges that prevent the routine publication of these resources as semantically enriched open data? What can be done to improve the situation? Where are the examples of the successful publication and exploitation of semantically enriched content? What lessons should we draw for the future?",http://iswc2014.semanticweb.org/keynote_nigel_shadbolt,,,,

Massive individual and territorial data sets – (open) public and private data, as well as their semantics which allows us to transform data into knowledge about the city and the community, are key enablers to the development of such solutions. Something more however is needed. A “smart” community needs “to do things” in a city, and the people need to act within their own community. For instance, not only do we need to know where we can find a parking spot, which cultural event is happening tonight, or when the next bus will arrive, but we also need to actually pay for parking our car, buy a bus ticket, or reserve a seat in the theater. All these activities (paying, booking, buying, etc.) need semantics in the same way as data does, and such a semantics should describe all the steps needed to perform such activities. Moreover, such a semantics should allow us to define and deploy solutions that are general and abstract enough to be “portable” across the details of the different ways in which activities can be implemented, e.g., by different providers, or for different customers, or for different cities. At the same time, in order to actually “do things”, we need a semantics that links general and abstract activities to the possibly different and specific ICT systems that implement them. In my talk, I will present some of the main problems for realizing the concept of smart city and community, and the need for semantics for both understanding data and “doing things”. I will discuss some alternative approaches, some lessons learned from applications we have been working with in this field, and the still many related open research challenges.",http://iswc2014.semanticweb.org/keynote_paolo_traverso,,,,
