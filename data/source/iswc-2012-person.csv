,"Nigel Shadbolt",,Nigel,Shadbolt,,"University of Southampton","United Kingdom",,"Nigel Shadbolt, Professor of Artificial Intelligence and Head of the Web and Internet Science Group at the University of Southampton has been confirmed as the dinner speaker. He is a Director of the Web Science Trust, and of the Web Foundation - both organisations have a common commitment to advance our understanding of the Web and promote the Webs positive impact on society. In June 2009 together with Sir Tim Berners-Lee he was appointed an Information Advisor by the Prime Minister to help transform public access to Government information. A major output of this work has been the widely acclaimed data.gov.uk site - a single point of access for all Government non-personal public data. In May 2010 he was appointed by the Coalition Government to the Public Sector Transparency Board responsible for setting open data standards across the public sector and developing the legal Right to Data.
