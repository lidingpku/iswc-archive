Vertical composition consists of defining an appropriate combination of simple processes to perform a composition task. Horizontal composition process consists of determining the most appropriate Web service, from among a set of functionally equivalent ones for each component process. Several recent research efforts have dealt with the Web service composition problem. Nevertheless, most of them tackled only the vertical composition of Web services despite the growing trend towards functionally equivalent Web services. In an attempt to facilitate and streamline the process of horizontal composition of Web services while taking the above limitation into consideration, this work includes two main contributions. The first is a generic formalization of any Web service composition problem based on a constraint optimization problem (COP); this formalization is compatible to any Web service description language. The second contribution is an incremental user-intervention-based protocol to find the optimal composite Web service according to some predefined criteria at run-time. Our goal is i) to deal with many crucial natural features of Web services such as dynamic and distributed environment, uncertain and incomplete Web service information, etc; and ii) to allow human user intervention to enhance the solving process. Three approaches are described in this work, sequential approach, distributed approach and multi-agent approach to deal with realistic domains.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2006,Research Track Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

This results in practice efficiency and growth by enabling physicians to see more patients with improved care.

Semantics enables Web service to describe their capabilities and processes, nevertheless there is still some work to be done. Indeed Web services described at functional level need a formal context to perform the automated composition of Web services. The suggested model (i.e. Causal link matrix) is a necessary starting point to apply problem-solving techniques such as regression-based search for Web service composition.

Resource access control is crucial to leverage ad-hoc collaboration. In pervasive scenarios, however, collaborating entities cannot be known in advance and resource availability frequently vary, even unpredictably, due to user/device mobility, thus complicating resource access control. Access control policies cannot be defined based on entity's identities/roles, as in traditional access control solutions, and cannot be all specified a priori to face any operative run time situation, but require continuous adjustments to adapt to the current. To address these issues, this paper advocates the adoption of novel access control policy models that follow two main design guidelines: context-awareness to control resource access on the basis of context visibility and to enable dynamic adaptation of policies depending on context changes, and semantic technologies for context/policy specification to allow high-level description and reasoning reason about context and policies. The paper describes also the implementation of these concepts in a semantic context-aware policy model that adopts ontologies and rules to express context and context-aware access control policies and to allow policy adaptation.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2006,Research Track Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

This has sparked a heated debate in the Semantic Web community, resulting in proposals for alternative ontology languages based entirely on logic programming. To help resolving this debate, we investigate the practical use cases which seem to be addressed by logic programming. In fact, many of these requirements have already been addressed outside of the Semantic Web. By drawing inspiration from these existing formalisms, we present a novel logic of hybrid MKNF knowledge bases, which seamlessly integrates OWL with LP.

This paper aims at contributing to the alleviation of this situation by proposing ONTOCOM (ONTOlogy COst Model), a model to predict the costs arising in ontology engineering processes. We introduce a methodology to generate a cost model adapted to a particular ontology development strategy, and an inventory of cost drivers which influence the amount of effort invested in activities performed during an ontology life cycle. We further present the results of the model validation procedure, which covered an expert-driven evaluation and a statistical calibration on 36 data points collected from real-world projects. The validation revealed that ontology engineering processes have a high learning rate, indicating that the building of very large ontologies is feasible from an economic point of view.

This paper introduces OntoSyphon, an alternative that strives to more fully leverage existing ontological content while scaling to extract comparatively shallow content from millions of documents. OntoSyphon operates in an ""ontology-driven"" manner: taking any ontology as input, OntoSyphon uses the ontology to specify web searches that identify possible semantic instances, relations, and taxonomic information. Redundancy in the web, together with information from the ontology, is then used to automatically verify these candidate instances and relations, enabling OntoSyphon to operate in a fully automated, unsupervised manner. A prototype of OntoSyphon is fully implemented and we present experimental results that demonstrate substantial instance learning in a variety of domains based on independently constructed ontologies.

We propose an approach for supporting the creation and exchange of different arguments, that support or reject possible correspondences. Each agent can decide, according to its preferences, whether to accept or refuse a candidate correspondence. The proposed framework considers arguments and propositions that are specific to the matching task and are based on the ontology semantics. This argumentation framework relies on a formal argument manipulation schema and on an encoding of the agents' preferences between particular kinds of arguments. Whilst the former does not vary between agents, the latter depends on the interests of each agent.

This approach reduces the run time complexity but increases the space requirements. The main reason of this increase is the type and subclass statements in the ontology. Type statements show a significant percentage in most ontologies. Since subclass is a transitive property, derivation of other statements, in particular type statements rely on it, gives rise to cyclic repetition and an excess of inferred type statements. In brief, a major part of closure computation is deriving the type statements relying on subclass statements. In this paper, we propose a syntactic transformation that is based on novel individual grouping constructs.

At this the fifth ISWC, it is time to re-examine the extent to which interdisciplinary work has played and can play a role in Semantic Web research, and even how Semantic Web research can contribute to other disciplines. Core Semantic Web research has drawn from various disciplines, such as knowledge representation and formal ontologies, reusing and further developing their techniques in a new context. However, there are several other disciplines that explore research issues very relevant to the Semantic Web in different guises and to differing extents. As a community, we can benefit by also recognizing and drawing from the research in these different disciplines. On the other hand, Semantic Web research also has much to contribute to these disciplines and communities. For example, the Semantic Web offers scenario that often ask for unprecedented scalability of techniques from other disciplines. Throughout the talk, I will illustrate these points through examples from disciplines such as natural language processing, databases, software engineering and automated reasoning. The industry also has a major role to play in the realization of the Semantic Web vision. I will therefore additionally examine the added value of Semantic Web technologies for commercial applications and discuss issues that should be addressed for broadening the market for Semantic Web technologies.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2006,Invited Talk Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

Recently, social annotation services have become more and more popular in Semantic Web. It allows users to arbitrarily annotate web resources, thus, largely lowers the barrier to cooperation. Furthermore, through providing abundant meta-data resources, social annotation might become a key to the development of Semantic Web. However, on the other hand, social annotation has its own apparent limitations, for instance, 1) ambiguity and synonym phenomena and 2) lack of hierarchical information. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised model to automatically derive hierarchical semantics from social annotations. Using a social bookmark service Del.icio.us as example, we demonstrate that the derived hierarchical semantics has the ability to compensate those shortcomings. We further apply our model on another data set from Flickr to testify our model's applicability on different environments.

Text categorization is the task of classifying text documents under predened categories. Accidentology is our application eld and the goal of our framework is to classify documents describing real road accidents under predened road accident prototpypes, which also are described by text documents. Accidents are described by accident reports while accident prototypes are described by accident scenarios. Thus, text categorization is done by assigning each accident report to an accident scenario, which highlights particular mechanisms leading to accident. We propose a textual case based reasoning approach (TCBR), which allows us to integrate both textual and domain knowledge aspects inorder to carry out this categorization. CBR solves a new problem (target case) by identifying its similarity to one or several previously solved problems (source cases) stored in a case base and by adapting their known solutions. Cases of our framework are created from text. Most of TCBR applications create cases from text by using Information Retrieval techniques, which leads to knowledge-poor descriptions of cases. We show that using semantic resources (two ontology of accidentology) makes possible to overcome this diculty, and allows us to enrich cases by using formal knowledge. In this paper, we argue that semantic resources are likely to improve the quality of cases created from text, and, therefore, such resources can support the reasoning cycle. We illustrate this claim with our framework developed to classify documents in the accidentology domain.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc-aswc/2007,Semantic Web In Use Track Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

While this is certainly useful, we argue that is not enough to model and construct complex data workflows. We present a planning approach to automatically constructing data processing workflows where the inputs and outputs of services are relational descriptions in an expressive logic.

However, at the same time, this is also one of their main disadvantages as these same labels are ambiguous and very hard to be reasoned about by software agents. This fact creates an insuperable hindrance for classifications to being embedded in the Semantic Web infrastructure. This paper presents an approach to converting classifications into lightweight ontologies, and it makes the following contributions: (i) it identifies the main NLP problems related to the conversion process and shows how they are different from the classical problems of NLP; (ii) it proposes heuristic solutions to these problems, which are especially effective in this domain; and (iii) it evaluates the proposed solutions by testing them on DMoz data.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc-aswc/2007,Research Track Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

The intuitive idea is that similar interactions follow similar conventions and patterns, which can be analysed. The computed model can be used to suggest the possible mappings for the exchanged messages in new interactions. The suggestions can be evaluate by any standard ontology matcher: if they are accurate, the matchers avoid evaluating mappings unrelated to the interaction.

Our approach exploits mappings between ontologies, which are used to reconcile both conceptual and individual level heterogeneity, and further used to draw the migration process. We ground the approach on a distributed description logic (DDL), in which ontologies are formally encoded as DL knowledge bases and mappings as bridge rules and individual correspondences. From the theoretical side, we study the task of reasoning with instance data in DDL composed of SHIQ ontologies and define a correct and complete distributed tableaux inference procedure.

Semantic interoperability among different information systems in the WWW is limited due to information heterogeneity problem. Ontologies have been suggested as a way to solve this problem. Given that no universal ontology exists for the WWW, work has focused on finding semantic correspondences between similar elements of different ontologies, i.e., ontology mapping. Ontology mapping can be done either by hand or using automated tools. Manual mapping becomes impractical as the size and complexity of ontologies increases. Fully or semi-automated mapping approaches have been examined by different research studies, e.g., analyzing linguistic information of elements in ontologies, treating ontologies as structural graphs, applying heuristic rules to look for specific mapping patterns and machine learning techniques. This paper proposes a new generic and scalable ontology mapping approach, which takes advantage of propagation theory, information retrieval technique and artificial intelligence model to solve ontology mapping problem. The major procedures of the proposed approach are profile enrichment, profile propagation, IR-based profile mapping and the interactive activation network based constraints satisfaction. The profile enrichment builds a profile for each element in the ontologies, and thus enriches its information. The profile propagation exploits the neighboring information of each element by passing the profile of the ancestors, descendants or siblings of the element to the profile of itself, with different weights. The IR-based profile mapping process compares the cosine similarity of elements' profiles in a vector space model. Finally the interactive activation network is integrated to deal with the constraints satisfaction problems in the context of ontology mapping.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc-aswc/2007,Doctoral Consortium Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

In general, these proposals reduce the autonomy of each ontology by defining the semantics of the ontology to depend on the semantics of the other ontologies. We propose a new framework for managing autonomy in a set of cooperating ontologies (or ontology space). In this framework, each language entity (concept/role/individual) in an ontology may have its meaning assigned either locally with respect to the semantics of its own ontology, to preserve the autonomy of the ontology, or globally with respect to the semantics of any neighbouring ontology in which it is defined, thus enabling semantic cooperation between multiple ontologies. In this way, each ontology has a ""subjective semantics"" based on local interpretation and a ""foreign semantics"" based on semantic binding to neighbouring ontologies. We study the properties of these two semantics and describe the conditions under which entailment and satisfiability are preserved. We also introduce two reasoning mechanisms under this framework: ""cautious reasoning"" and ""brave reasoning"". Cautious reasoning is done with respect to a local ontology and its neighbours (those ontologies in which its entities are defined); brave reasoning is done with respect to the transitive closure of this relationship. This framework is independent of ontology languages.

ALBO is the extension of ALC with the Boolean role operators, inverse of roles, domain and range restriction operators and it includes full support for objects (nominals). ALBO is a very expressive description logic which is NExpTime complete and subsumes Boolean modal logic and the two-variable fragment of first-order logic.

In this paper, we present a Protege plugin which supports the systematic reuse of global identifiers for instances in RDF/OWL knowledge base. The plugin is an extension of the ""individual"" tab. The main difference is that, when an instance is created, the user has a chance of looking for a pre-existing URI for the corresponding individual in a publicly available service called OKKAM. The match between the newly created instance and the stored individuals is based on an algorithm which compares the features of the new isntance with a simple profile stored in OKKAM for all individuals.

We observe that (1) in terms of performance and scalability, a simple triple store built on top of a column-store DBMS is competitive to the vertically partitioned approach when choosing a physical (predicate, subject, object) sort order, (2) in our scenario with real-world queries, none of the approaches scales to documents containing tens of millions of RDF triples, and (3) none of the approaches yet can compete with a purely relational model.

First, the result quality increases monotonically and converges with each evolution, offering ``anytime'' behaviour with arbitrary trade-off between computation time and query results; in addition, the level of approximation can be tuned by varying the size of the bloomfilters. Secondly, through bloomfilter compression we can fit large graphs in main memory, reducing the need for disk I/O during query evaluation.

As part of this architecture, specific controlled vocabularies, such as the IPTC News Codes, are used to categorize news items together with other industry-standard thesauri. While news is still mainly in the form of text-based stories, these are often illustrated with graphics, images and videos. Media-specific metadata formats, such as EXIF, DIG35 and XMP, are used to describe the media. The use of different metadata formats in a single production process leads to interoperability problems within the news production chain itself. It also excludes linking to existing web knowledge resources and impedes the construction of uniform end-user interfaces for searching and browsing news content. In order to allow these different metadata standards to interoperate within a single information environment, we design an OWL ontology for the IPTC News Architecture, linked with other multimedia metadata standards. We convert the IPTC NewsCodes into a SKOS thesaurus and we demonstrate how the news metadata can then be enriched using natural language processing and multimedia analysis and integrated with existing knowledge already formalized on the Semantic Web. We discuss the method we used for developing the ontology and give rationale for our design decisions. We provide guidelines for re-engineering schemas into ontologies and formalize their implicit semantics.

Towards this end, we define a framework that uses a DL reasoner to reason over the TBox of the ontology (hybrid-like) and a rule engine to apply a domain-specific version of ABox-related entailments (homogeneous-like) that are generated by TBox queries to the DL reasoner.

Firstly, it disengages the manipulation of the TBox semantics from any incomplete entailment-based approach, using the efficient DL algorithms.

The majority of currently existing approaches focuses on centralized architectures, and deals with efficiency typically by pre-computing and storing the results of the semantic matcher for all possible query concepts. Such approaches, however, fail to scale with respect to the number of service advertisements and the size of the ontologies involved. On the other hand, this paper presents an efficient and scalable index-based method for Semantic Web service discovery that allows for fast selection of services at query time and is suitable for both centralized and P2P environments. We employ a novel encoding of the services descriptions, allowing the match between a request and an advertisement to be evaluated in constant time, and we index these representations to prune the search space, reducing the number of comparisons required. Given a desired ranking function, the search algorithm can retrieve the top-k matches progressively, i.e., better matches are computed and returned first, thereby further reducing the search engine's response time. We show also how this search can be performed efficiently in a suitable structured P2P overlay network. The benefits of the proposed method are demonstrated through experimental evaluation on both real and synthetic data.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2008,Research Track Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

This is achieved by marking up services with ontology-based semantic descriptions. The OWL Services (OWL-S) ontology is an upper ontology in OWL language, providing essential vocabularies to semantically describe Web services. Currently OWL-S services can only be developed independently, if one service is unavailable then finding a suitable alternative would require an expensive and difficult global search/match. It is desirable to have a new OWL-S construct that can systematically support substitution tracing as well as incremental development and reuse for services. Introducing inheritance relationship (IR) into OWLS is a natural solution. However, OWL-S, as well as most of the other currently discussed formalisms for Semantic Web Services such as WSMO or SAWSDL, has yet to define a concrete and self-contained mechanism of establishing inheritance relationships among services, which we believe is very important for the automated creation and discovery of Web services as well as human organization of services into a taxonomy-like structure. In this paper, we extend OWL-S with the possibility to define and maintain inheritance relationships between services. Through the definition of an additional “inheritance profile”, inheritance relationships can be stated and reasoned about. Two types of IRs are allowed to grant service developers the choice to respect the “contract” between services or not. The proposed inheritance framework has also been implemented and the prototype will be discussed as well.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2008,Research Track Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

We then introduce a new algorithm based on frequent itemsets mining that efficiently learns an ontology over the concepts present in the enriched folksonomy.

Since justifications respect the syntactic form of axioms in an ontology, they are usually neither syntactically nor semantically minimal. This paper presents two new subclasses of justifications - laconic justications and precise justications. Laconic justications only consist of axioms that do not contain any redundant parts. Precise justications can be derived from laconic justications and are characterised by the fact that they consist of flat, small axioms, which facilitate the generation of semantically minimal repairs. Formal denitions for both types of justication are presented. In contrast to previous work in this area, these definitions make it clear as to what exactly parts of axioms are. In order to demonstrate the practicability of computing laconic, and hence precise justications, an algorithm is provided and results from an empirical evaluation carried out on several published ontologies are presented. The evaluation showed that laconic/precise justications can be computed in a reasonable time for entailments in a range of ontologies that vary in size and complexity. It was found that in half of the ontologies sampled there were entailments that had more laconic/precise justications than regular justications.

In this paper we propose a probabilistic modeling framework that combines both human-defined concepts and data-driven topics in a principled manner. The methodology we propose uses statistical topic models (also known as latent Dirichlet allocation models). We demonstrate the utility of this general framework in two ways. We first illustrate how the methodology can be used to automatically tag Web pages with concepts from a known set of concepts without any need for labeled documents.

However, although RDF is a directed labeled graph data format, the W3C Recommendation query language for RDF, SPARQL, only provides limited navigational functionalities. This has motivated several authors to propose extensions of SPARQL, or alternative query languages, that offer functionalities for navigating RDF data. In particular, we argued in [6] that nested regular expressions are appropriate to overcome this limitation, and we proposed a query language called nSPARQL that extends SPARQL with this type of expressions. In this paper, we continue with the investigation of nSPARQL. First, we show that nested regular expressions can be evaluated efficiently; if the appropriate data structure is used to store RDF graphs, then the evaluation of a nested regular expression E over an RDF graph G can be computed in time O(|G|*|E|). Second, as RDF graphs may contain RDFS vocabulary, we study how the navigational capabilities of nSPARQL can be used to evaluate queries according to the predefined semantics of RDFS. Evaluating queries which involve the RDFS vocabulary is challenging, and there is not yet consensus in the Semantic Web community on how to define a query language for RDFS. In this respect, we show that nSPARQL is expressive enough to answer SPARQL queries involving RDFS vocabulary by directly traversing the input RDF graphs. Moreover, we also prove that nesting is necessary to obtain this result. Namely, we show that, in general, regular expressions alone cannot be used to obtain the answer of a SPARQL query involving RDFS vocabulary.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2008,Research Track Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

We propose to distinguish between certain and cached information when reasoning on the semantic web, by extending the well known FOUR bilattice of truth and knowledge orders to FOUR-C, taking into account cached information. We discuss how users can be offered additional information about the reliability of inferred information, based on the availability of the corresponding information sources. We then extend the framework towards FOUR-T , allowing for multiple levels of trust on data sources. In this extended setting, knowledge about trust in information sources can be used to compute, how well an inferred statement can be trusted and to resolve inconsistencies arising from connecting multiple data sources.

Also, a very specific vocabulary has evolved, in particular in the SAP domain (e.g. SAP Solution Maps or SAP software module names). This vocabulary is not clearly mapped to business management terminology and concepts. It is a well-known problem in practice that searching in SAP ERP documentation is difficult, because it requires in-depth knowledge of a large and proprietary terminology. We propose to use ontologies and automatic annotation of such large HTML software documentation in order to improve the usability and accessibility, namely of ERP help files. In order to achieve that, we have developed an ontology and prototype for SAP ERP 6.0. Our approach integrates concepts and lexical resources from (1) business management terminology, (2) SAP business terminology, (3) SAP system terminology, and (4) Wordnet synsets. We use standard GATE/KIM technology to annotate SAP help documentation with respective references to our ontology. Eventually, our approach consolidates the knowledge contained in the SAP help functionality at a conceptual level. This allows users to express their queries using a terminology they are familiar with, e.g. referring to general management terms. Despite a widely automated ontology construction process and a simplistic annotation strategy with minimal human intervention, we experienced convincing results. For an average query linked to an action and a topic, our technology returns more than 3 relevant resources, while a naïve term-based search returns on average only about 0.2 relevant resources.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2008,Semantic Web In Use Track Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

Since P-SHIQ(D) is a relatively new formalism for handling uncertainty in DL knowledge bases, no such methodology has been proposed so far. Moreover there are no sufficiently large probabilistic ontologies to be used as test suites. In addition, since the reasoning services in P-SHIQ(D) are mostly query oriented, there is no single problem (like classification or realization in classical DL) that could be an obvious candidate for benchmarking. All these issues make it hard to evaluate the performance of reasoners, reveal the complexity bottlenecks and assess the effect of optimization strategies. This paper aims at alleviating these important problems by making the following contributions: First, it describes a probabilistic ontology that has been developed for the real-life domain of breast cancer and which poses significant challenges for the state-of-art P-SHIQ(D) reasoners. Second, it explains a systematic approach to generating a series of probabilistic reasoning problems that allow to evaluate the reasoning performance and shed light on what makes reasoning in P-SHIQ(D) hard in practice. Finally, the paper explains the optimization strategy that helps to overcome some of the difficulties of reasoning revealed during the experiments.

Metadata management systems are growing from tool-specific repositories to enterprise-wide metadata repositories. In this context, one challenge is the management of the evolving metadata whose schema or meta-model itself may evolve, e.g., dynamically-added properties, which are often hard to predict upfront at the initial meta-model design time; another challenge is to organize the metadata by semantically-rich classification schemes. In this paper, we present a practical system which provides support for users to dynamically manage semantically-rich properties and classifications in the IBM WebSphere Metadata Server (MDS) by integrating an OWL ontology repository. To enable the smooth acceptance of Semantic Web technologies for developers of commercial software which must run 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, the system is designed to consist of integrated modeling paradigms, with an integrated query language and runtime repository. Specifically, we propose the modeling of dynamic properties on structured metadata as OWL properties and the modeling of classification schemes as OWL ontologies for metadata classification. We present a natural extension to OQL (Object Query Language)-like query language to embrace dynamic properties and metadata classification. We also observe that hybrid storage, i.e., horizontal tables for structured metadata and vertical triple tables for dynamic properties and classification, is suitable for the storage and query processing of co-existing structured metadata and semantic metadata. We believe that our study and experience are not specific to MDS, but are valuable for the community trying to apply Semantic Web technologies to the structured data management area.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2008,Semantic Web In Use Track Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

Even many of the ontologies that are in use today turn out to be inconsistent once some of their implicit knowledge is made explicit. However, robust and efficient methods to deal with inconsistencies are lacking from current Semantic Web reasoning systems, which are typically based on classical logic. In earlier papers, we have proposed the use of syntactic relevance functions as a method for reasoning with inconsistent ontologies. In this paper, we extend that work to the use of semantic distances. We show how Google distances can be used to develop semantic relevance functions to reason with inconsistent ontologies. In essence we are using the implicit knowledge hidden in the Web for explicit reasoning purposes. We have implemented this approach as part of the PION reasoning system. We report on experiments with several realistic ontologies. The test results show that a mixed syntactic/semantic approach can significantly improve reasoning performance over the purely syntactic approach. Furthermore, our methods allow to trade-off computational cost for inferential completeness.

BioPortal defines relationships among those ontologies and between the ontologies and online data resources such as PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). BioPortal supports not only the technical requirements for access to biomedical ontologies either via Web browsers or via Web services, but also community-based participation in the evaluation and evolution of ontology content.

Towards the goal of a simplified framework for metadata representation, federation, search and analysis, in the UMRR (Unified Metadata Registry and Repository) project at IBM, we propose and implement an open Web architecture for universal metadata management, where the Resource Description Framework (RDF) is adopted to represent the underlying metadata that are in various formats and the “Linked Data” method is leveraged to build a web of models. Our demonstration illustrates the effectiveness of this architecture to enable the metadata federation such that the global query, search and analysis on the metadata are feasible.

In this paper, we propose to make URIs published on Data Web RDF dereferencable, and we formalize such a requirement in an RDF-compatible semantics.

Such issues impede the move towards semantic standardization needed for their intended knowledge managment task. Rather it leads to inconsistencies, fragmentation and overlap both within and inbetween different biomedical ontologies. In light of this we introduce BioTop and ChemTop, two top-domain ontologies containing definitions for the most important, foundational entities necesarry to describe the various phenomena in biology and chemistry.

The advantage of using this method is that the canonical form can be indexed by the search engine, reducing the search for equivalent ontologies to a usual text search operation using the canonical form.

However, the openness of the Semantic Web means that the notion of there being common domain ontologies sufficient to cater for the requirements of a diverse range of consumers and producers of services has become untenable. In these types of environments it is necessary to consider that no ontology can be expected to remain unchanged throughout its lifetime. However, the dynamism and the large scale of the environment prevent the use of traditional ontology evolution techniques, where changes are mediated by a knowledge engineer [3]. We argue that the ability to estimate the impact of change a priori, i.e. before performing the change itself, is crucial, since this estimate can be used to assess the usefulness of the change. We assume that agents are capable of rational behaviour, and that they decide whether to change the ontology they commit to if the cost of the change (in terms of reclassiﬁcation of knowledge) is offset by the beneﬁts derived from the ability of a system to acquire new capabilities and therefore to achieve new tasks (or answer new queries, in the case of knowledge based systems). However, the agent’s decision making process follows the principle of bounded rationality [5]: agents operate with limited computational resources, and with partial knowledge of the environment [4]. We present an approach that evaluates the impact of change on an ontology a priori, without using reasoning, by estimating which set of axioms in an ontology is impacted by the change.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2008,Poster/Demo Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

In this paper we propose a graph-theoretic measure called noc-order for ranking nodes in RDF graphs based on the notion of centrality. We illustrate that this method is able to capture interesting global properties of the underlying RDF graph using study cases from different knowledge domains. We also show how well noc-order behaves even if the underlying data has some noise, i.e. superfluous and/or erroneous data. Finally, we discuss how information about the importance of different predicates either based on their informativeness, prior semantic information about them or user preferences can be incorporated into this measure.

Most data in the current web is managed by relational databases. Thus, it is imperative for the Semantic Web community to offer easily implemented solutions to bridging relational database content and RDF. Direct mappings means to use the SQL schema to create an OWL ontology and use it to represent the data in RDF. Direct mapping methods have an advantage that they are, intrinsically, automated. If a SQL-schema was created using contemporary model-driven software engineering tools, the resulting OWL ontology can be semantically rich. However, few SQL databases are so developed and therefore semantically weak. We suggest that direct-mapping methods can be integrated by a refinement process.

The method does not require a training set and is based on measuring the semantic similarity of the thematic graph created from a text document and the ontology fragments created by the projection of the defined contexts. The domain ontology together with the defined contexts effectively becomes the classifier, as it includes all of the necessary semantic and structural features of the classification categories. With the proposed approach, we can also dynamically change the classification categories without the need to retrain the classifier. In our experiments, we used an RDF ontology created from the full version of the English language Wikipedia to categorize a set of CNN documents and a subset of the Reuters RCV1 corpora. The high accuracy achieved in our tests demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method and applicability of Wikipedia for semantic text categorization.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2008,Poster/Demo Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

Second Life is a virtual 3D world, in which users can communicate, build objects, and explore the land of other users. There are different kinds of entities in Second Life, which can be locations, objects, or events. Many of these entities are of potential interest to users. However, searching for entities is difficult in Second Life, since there is only a very limited way to describe entities. With semSL it becomes possible for every user to add arbitrary tags or key/value pair based descriptions to entities in Second Life, or to create typed links between entities. Such typed links can even be established between entities in Second Life and resources from the Semantic Web. The description data for all such entities is centrally stored at a server external to Second Life. The data is encoded in RDF, and is publicly accessible via a SPARQL endpoint. This should not only lead to significant improvements for searching operations, but will also allow for flexible data integration between data from semSL and data from other sources on the Semantic Web.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2008,Poster/Demo Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

Several proposals for hybrid languages allow concepts to be simultaneously defined by an ontology and rules, where rules may refer to concepts in the ontology and the ontology may also refer to predicates defined by the rules. Hybrid MKNF knowledge bases are one such proposal, for which both a stable and a well-founded semantics have been defined. The definition of Hybrid MKNF knowledge bases is parametric on the ontology language, in the sense that non-monotonic rules can extend any decidable ontology language. In this paper we define a query-driven procedure for Hybrid MKNF knowledge bases that is sound with respect to the original stable model-based semantics, and is correct with respect to the well-founded semantics. This procedure is able to answer conjunctive queries, and is parametric on an inference engine for reasoning in the ontology language. Our procedure is based on an extension of a tabled rule evaluation to capture reasoning within an ontology by modeling it as an interaction with an external oracle and, with some assumptions on the complexity of the oracle compared to the complexity of the ontology language, maintains the data complexity of the well-founded semantics for hybrid MKNF knowledge bases.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2009,Research Track Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

This approach guarantees sound and complete results for the category of conjunctive queries that the applied OWL DL reasoner correctly evaluates.

This is because a syntactic locality-based module is independent of the super-concept in a subsumption entailment and always contains all concept/role assertions. In order to extract smaller modules to further optimize finding all justifications in an OWL DL ontology, we propose a goal-directed method for extracting a module that preserves all justifications of a given entailment.

Existing methods for graph-based authority ranking lack support for fine-grained latent coherence between resources and predicates (i.e. support for link semantics in the linked data model). In this paper, we present TripleRank, a novel approach for faceted authority ranking in the context of RDF knowledge bases. TripleRank captures the additional latent semantics of Semantic Web data by means of statistical methods in order to produce richer descriptions of the available data. We model the Semantic Web by a 3-dimensional tensor that enables the seamless representation of arbitrary semantic links. For the analysis of that model, we apply the PARAFAC decomposition, which can be seen as a multi-modal counterpart to Web authority ranking with HITS. The result are groupings of resources and predicates that characterize their authority and navigational (hub) properties with respect to identified topics.

Existing ranking algorithms for structured data, on the other hand, require manual input of a domain expert and are thus not applicable in cases where data integrated from a large number of sources exhibits enormous variance in vocabularies used. In such environments, the authority of data sources is an important signal that the ranking algorithm has to take into account. This paper presents algorithms for prioritising data returned by queries over web datasets expressed in RDF. We introduce the notion of naming authority which provides a correspondence between identifiers and the sources which can speak authoritatively for these identifiers. Our algorithm uses the original PageRank method to assign authority values to data sources based on a naming authority graph, and then propagates the authority values to identifiers referenced in the sources. We conduct performance and quality evaluations of the method on a large web dataset.

In this paper we present an approach to execute SPARQL queries over the Web of Linked Data.

This discovery is driven by following RDF links between data sources based on URIs in the query and in partial results. The URIs are resolved over the HTTP protocol into RDF data which is continuously added to the queried dataset. This paper describes concepts and algorithms to implement our approach using an iterator-based pipeline.

In this paper, we show that SPARQL faces certain unwanted ramifications when querying ontologies in conjunction with RDF datasets that comprise multiple named graphs, and we provide an extension for SPARQL that remedies these effects. Moreover, since RDFS inference has a close relationship with logic rules, we generalize our approach to select a custom ruleset for specifying inferences to be taken into account in a SPARQL query. We show that our extensions are technically feasible by providing benchmark results for RDFS querying in our prototype system GiaBATA, which uses Datalog coupled with a persistent Relational Database as a back-end for implementing SPARQL with dynamic rule-based inference.

Instead of materializing a large number of different sub-ontologies, we propose to keep just one ontology, but equip each axiom with a label from an appropriate labeling lattice. The access right, required trust level, etc. is then also represented by a label (called user label) from this lattice, and the corresponding sub-ontology is determined by comparing this label with the axiom labels. For large-scale ontologies, certain consequence (like the concept hierarchy) are often precomputed. Instead of precomputing these consequences for every possible sub-ontology, our approach computes just one label for each consequence such that a comparison of the user label with the consequence label determines whether the consequence follows from the corresponding sub-ontology or not. In this paper we determine under which restrictions on the user and axiom labels such consequence labels (called boundaries) always exist, describe different black-box approaches for computing boundaries, and present first experimental results that compare the efficiency of these approaches on large real-world ontologies. Black-box means that, rather than requiring modifications of existing reasoning procedures, these approaches can use such procedures directly as sub-procedures, which allows us to employ existing highly-optimized reasoners.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2009,Research Track Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

This problem is often called a mapping revision problem, as the ontologies are assumed to be correct, whereas the mappings are repaired when resolving the inconsistencies. In this paper, we first propose a conflict-based mapping revision operator and show that it can be characterized by two logical postulates adapted from some existing postulates for belief base revision. We then provide an algorithm for iterative mapping revision by using an ontology revision operator and show that this algorithm defines a conflict-based mapping revision operator.

Many methods have been proposed for automatically finding the alignment between heterogeneous ontologies. However, in many real-world applications, finding the alignment in a completely automatic way is highly infeasible. Ideally, an ontology matching system would have an interactive interface to allow users to provide feedbacks to guide the automatic algorithm. Fundamentally, we need answer the following questions: how can a system perform an efficiently interactive process with the user? How many interactions are sufficient for finding a more accurate matching? To address these questions, we propose an active learning framework for ontology matching, which tries to find the most informative candidate matches to query the user. The user's feedbacks are used to: 1) correct the mistake matching and 2) propagate the supervise information to help the entire matching process. Three measures are proposed to estimate the confidence of each matching candidate. A correct propagation algorithm is further proposed to maximize the spread of the user's guidance"". Experimental results on several public data sets show that the proposed approach can significantly improve the matching accuracy (+8.0% better than the baseline methods).""",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2009,Research Track Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

Regulations are traditionally enforced at design time by verifying that a workflow or composition adheres to regulations.

Attempts have previously been made to address the problem of forgetting in relatively simple description logics (DLs) such as DL-Lite and extended EL. The ontologies used in these attempts were mostly restricted to TBoxes rather than general knowledge bases (KBs). However, the issue of forgetting for general KBs in more expressive description logics, such as ALC and OWL DL, is largely unexplored. In particular, the problem of characterizing and computing forgetting for such logics is still open. In this paper, we first define semantic forgetting about concepts and roles in ALC ontologies and state several important properties of forgetting in this setting. We then define the result of forgetting for concept descriptions in ALC, state the properties of forgetting for concept descriptions, and present algorithms for computing the result of forgetting for concept descriptions. Unlike the case of DL-Lite, the result of forgetting for an ALC ontology does not exist in general, even for the special case of concept forgetting. This makes the problem of how to compute forgetting in ALC more challenging. We address this problem by defining a series of approximations to the result of forgetting for ALC ontologies and studying their properties and their application to reasoning tasks. We use the algorithms for computing forgetting for concept descriptions to compute these approximations. Our algorithms for computing approximations can be embedded into an ontology editor to enhance its ability to manage and reason in (large) ontologies.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2009,Research Track Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

In this paper we tackle one of the most popular CMS: Drupal. We enable site administrators to export their site content model and data to the Web of Data without requiring extensive knowledge on Semantic Web technologies. Our modules create RDFa annotations and -- optionally -- a SPARQL endpoint for any Drupal site out of the box. Likewise, we add the means to map the site data to existing ontologies on the Web with a search interface to find commonly used ontology terms. We also allow a Drupal site administrator to include existing RDF data from remote SPARQL endpoints on the Web in the site. When brought together, these features allow networked RDF Drupal sites that reuse and enrich Linked Data.

Such an analysis needs to find the concepts and the relationships that should form the ontology. However, since relationship extraction methods are imprecise and cannot homogeneously cover all concepts, the initial set of relationships is usually inconsistent and rather imbalanced - a problem which, to the best of our knowledge, was mostly ignored so far. In this paper, we define the problem of extracting a consistent as well as properly structured ontology from a set of inconsistent and heterogeneous relationships. Moreover, we propose and compare three graph-based methods for solving the ontology extraction problem.

There is therefore a growing need for indexes that can operate efficiently when the index itself resides on disk. In this paper, we first propose the DOGMA index for fast subgraph matching on disk and then develop a basic algorithm to answer queries over this index. This algorithm is then significantly sped up via an optimized algorithm that uses efficient (but correct) pruning strategies when combined with two different extensions of the index. We have implemented a preliminary system and tested it against four existing RDF database systems developed by others.

We consider here a third approach: developing software that automatically extracts structured information from unstructured text present on the web. This talk will survey attempts to extract structured knowledge from unstructured text, and will focus on an approach with three characteristics that we hypothesize make it viable. First, in contrast to the very difficult problem of reading information from a single document, we consider the much easier problem of reading hundreds of millions of documents simultaneously, so that our system can extract facts that are stated manytimes by combining evidence from many documents. Second, our system begins with a given ontology that defines the types of information to be extracted, enabling it to focus its effort and to ignore most of the text that is irrelevant to the target ontology. Third, the system uses a new class of semi-supervised learning algorithms to learn how to extract information from web pages -- algorithms designed to achieve greater accuracy when given more complex ontologies. Our experiments show that this approach can produce knowledge bases containing tens of thousands of facts to populate given ontologies with approximately 90% accuracy, starting with only a handful of labeled training examples and 200 million unlabeled web pages.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2009,Invited Talk Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

However Analogy Space faces difficulty with networks having more than a few thousand nodes.

A semantic ontology is a natural candidate for data representation for three reasons: first, the hierarchical class structure of an OWL-Ontology helps avoid redundancy when developing simulations, as an operation can be applied to a class and all its subclasses; secondly, a framework like Jena helps eliminate human error and reduce the amount of data entry that needs to be performed; and finally, important restrictions regarding data entry are imposed by the ontological structure and Jena, as opposed to by a proprietary system developed for one specific application.

This year, for the first time in its long history, the library community is making that experience and knowledge freely available as a coordinated set of controlled vocabularies and upper-level ontologies. Resource Description and Access (RDA) is the international library community's new standard for resource description. A component of this standard -- the RDA Vocabularies -- will finally allow libraries to make the vast silos of library and museum metadata publicly available as semantically rich linked data, and provide the semantic web and linked data communities access to more than a century of library experience in describing resources. The Open Metadata Registry is hosting these vocabularies. The Registry is an Open Source, non-commercial project specifically designed to provide individuals, communities, and organizations an easy-to-use platform supporting the development and dissemination of multi-lingual controlled vocabularies and upper-level and domain-specific ontologies.

The decisions about how SPoX reacts are defined by means of Semantic Web policies that do not only consider the context of the user (such as time or on-line status) but include Social Semantic Web data into the policy reasoning process. By this means, users can state that, for instance, only people defined as friends in their FOAF profile, only friends on Twitter, or even only people they wrote a paper with are allowed to call.

While in many cases, just presenting the justification is sufficient for user understanding, and in all cases justifications are much better than nothing, we have empirically identified cases where understanding how a justification supports an entailment is inordinately difficult. Indeed there are naturally occurring justifications that people, with varying expertise in OWL, cannot understand. To address this problem, we have developed a novel conceptual framework for justification oriented proofs. Given a justification for an entailment in an ontology, intermediate inference steps, called lemmas, are automatically derived, that bridge the gap between the axioms in the justification and the entailment. The proof shows in a stepwise way how the lemmas and ultimately the entailment follow from the justification. At the heart of the framework is the notion of a ``complexity model'', which predicts how easy or difficult it is for a user to understand a justification, and is used for selecting the lemmas to insert into a proof. This poster and demo presents this framework backed by a prototype implementation.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2009,Poster/Demo Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

In this paper, we propose a framework that is grounded on logic and the Local-As-View approach for representing instances of the service selection problem. In our approach,Web services are semantically described using LAV mappings in terms of generic concepts from an ontology, user requests correspond to conjunctive queries on the generic concepts and, in addition, the user may specify a set of preferences that are used to rank the possible solutions to the given request. The LAV formulation allows us to cast the service selection problem as a query rewriting problem that must consider the relationships among the concepts in the ontology and the ranks induced by the preferences. Then, building on related work, we devise an encoding of the resulting query rewriting problem as a logical theory whose models are in correspondence with the solutions of the user request, and in presence of preferences, whose best models are in correspondence with the best-ranked solutions. Thus, by exploiting known properties of modern SAT solvers, we provide an efficient and scalable solution to the service selection problem.

And I believe it will be of similar importance to the semantic web. Once you are talking about searching from billions of objects, it will be impossible to always give a single right result, no matter how intelligent the search engine is. Instead, a set of possible results will be provided for the user to choose from. Moreover, if we consider the trade-off between the system costs of generating a single right result and a set of possible results, we may choose the latter. This will naturally lead to the question of how to decide on and present the set to the user and how to evaluate the outcome. In this presentation, I will talk about some new results in the methodology and technology developed for evaluation of web search technologies and systems. As we know, the dominant method for evaluating search engines is the Cranfield paradigm, which employs a test collection to qualify the systems' performance. However, the modern search engines are much different than the traditional information retrieval systems when the Cranfield paradigm was proposed: 1. Mostmodernsearchengineshavemuchmorefeatures,suchasquery-dependent document snippets and query suggestions, and the quality of such features can affect the users' effectiveness to find out useful information; 2. The document collections used in search engines are much larger than ever, so the complete test collection that contain all query-document judgments is not available. As response to the above differences and difficulties, the evaluation based on implicit feedback is a promising alternative methodology employed in IR evaluation. With this approach, no extra human effort is required to judge the querydocument relevance. Instead, such judgments information can be automatically predicted from real users' implicit feedback data. There are three key issues in this methodology: 1. How to predict the query-document relevance and other useful features that useful to qualify the search engine performance; 2. If the complete ""judgments"" are not available, how can we efficiently collect the most critical information that can determine the system performance; 3. Because more than query-document relevance features can affect the performance, how can they integrate to be a good metric to predict the system performance. We will show a set of technologies dealing with these issues. While semantic web search may present different requirements from web search, evaluation of any search technology will be inevitable. As such, I hope the materials covered in the talk will benefit some of you in semantic web community in the future.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2010,Invited Talk Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

We review known model and formula-based approaches for evolution of propositional theories. We exhibit limitations of a number of model-based approaches: besides the fact that they are either not expressible in DL-Lite or hard to compute, they intrinsically ignore the structural properties of KBs, which leads to undesired properties of KBs resulting from such an evolution. We also examine proposals on update and revision of DL KBs that adopt the model-based approaches and discuss their drawbacks. We show that known formula-based approaches are also not appropriate for DL-Lite evolution, either due to high complexity of computation, or because the result of such an action of evolution is not expressible in DL-Lite. Building upon the insights gained, we propose two novel formula-based approaches that respect our principles and for which evolution is expressible in DL-Lite. For our approaches we also developed polynomial time algorithms to compute evolution of DL-Lite KBs.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2010,Research Track Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

In addition, in many cases they miss important mappings due to poorly developed ontology structures or dissimilar ontology designs. I propose a complementary approach making massive use of relation extraction techniques applied to broad-coverage text corpora.

The aim of (i) is to enable transparent transformations between these two representation formats, relying on a new query language called XSPARQL. On a different aspect, representing and reasoning with meta-information about RDF triples has been addressed by several proposals for representing time, trust and provenance. A common extension of RDF (and RDFS inferencing rules), capable of encompassing all these proposals, with a clearly defined semantics is much desirable. Building on top of Annotated RDF, we present such an extension and an extension of the SPARQL language capable of querying triples with annotations.

In this paper, we present concepts and algorithms to analyse and repair the brittleness of the Web of Data. We apply these on a substantial subset of it, the 2010 Billion Triple Challenge dataset. We first distinguish the physical structure of the Web of Data from its semantic structure. For both of these structures, we then calculate their robustness, taking betweenness centrality as a robustness-measure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such robustness-indicators have been calculated for the Web of Data. Finally, we determine which links should be added to the Web of Data in order to improve its robustness most effectively. We are able to determine such links by interpreting the question as a very large optimisation problem and deploying an evolutionary algorithm to solve this problem.

Thus, we present and evaluate an on-line approach that forgets fragments from an OWL ontology that are infrequently or no longer used, or are cheap to relearn, in terms of time and resources. In order to evaluate our approach, we situate it in a controlled simulation environment, RoboCup OWLRescue, which is an extension of the widely used RoboCup Rescue platform, which enables agents to build ontologies automatically based on the tasks they are required to perform.

Explicitly formulating these mappings demands a comprehensive understanding of the underlying schemas (RDF ontologies) of the source and target datasets. This task can be supported by integrating the process of schema exploration into the mapping process and help the application designer with finding the implicit relationships that she wants to map.

Justifications are generally small and relatively easy to analyse, which makes them very suitable for transparent analytic micro-benchmarks.

We identify and systematically discuss three main strategies: a bottom-up strategy that discovers new sources during query processing by following links between sources, a top-down strategy that relies on complete knowledge about the sources to select and process relevant sources, and a mixed strategy that assumes some incomplete knowledge and discovers new sources at run-time. To exploit knowledge discovered at run-time, we propose an additional step, explicitly scheduled during query processing, called correct source ranking. Additionally, we propose the adoption of stream-based query processing to deal with the unpredictable nature of data access in the distributed Linked Data environment. In experiments, we show that our implementation of the mixed strategy leads to early reporting of results and thus, more responsive query processing, while not requiring complete knowledge.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2010,Research Track Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

Specifically our algorithm produces equivalence and subsumption relationships between classes from ontologies of different Linked Data sources by exploring the space of hypotheses supported by the existing equivalence statements. We are also able to generate a complementary hierarchy of derived classes within an existing ontology or generate new classes for a second source where the ontology is not as refined as the first. We demonstrate empirically our approach using Linked Data sources from the geospatial, genetics, and zoology domains. Our algorithm discovered about 800 equivalences and 29,000 subset relationships in the alignment of five source pairs from these domains.

The former accounts for known relations between ontologies, while the latter reflects the possibility to perform actions such as instance import or query translation.

Yet, careful analysis and evaluation of the characteristics of our data-using metrics-often leads to dramatic improvements in performance. Firstly, are current scalable systems scalable enough? We found that for large or deep ontologies (some as large as 500,000 classes) it is hard to say because benchmarks obscure the load-time costs for materialization. Therefore, to expose those costs, we have synthesized a set of more representative ontologies. Secondly, in designing for scalability, how do we manage knowledge over time? By optimizing for data distribution and ontology evolution, we have reduced the population time, including materialization, for the NCBO Resource Index, a knowledge base of 16.4 billion annotations linking 2.4 million terms from 200 ontologies to 3.5 million data elements, from one week to less than one hour for one of the large datasets on the same machine.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2010,Research Track Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

In this paper, we propose to analyze structured queries to help identifying missing metadata. We conduct a study on Semantic MediaWiki (SMW), one of the most popular Semantic Web applications to date, analyzing structured ""ask""-queries in public SMWinstances.

While there is existing work on detecting syntactical and structural changes in ontologies, there is still a need in analyzing and recognizing ontology changes and refactorings by a semantically comparison of ontology versions.

This confronts researchers with a conundrum: Whilst the data is available the programming models that facilitate scalability and the infrastructure to run various algorithms on the graph are missing. Some use MapReduce - a good solution for many problems. However, even some simple iterative graph algorithms do not map nicely to that programming model requiring programmers to shoehorn their problem to the MapReduce model. This paper presents the Signal/Collect programming model for synchronous and asynchronous graph algorithms. We demonstrate that this abstraction can capture the essence of many algorithms on graphs in a concise and elegant way by giving Signal/Collect adaptations of various relevant algorithms. Furthermore, we built and evaluated a prototype Signal/Collect framework that executes algorithms in our pro- gramming model. We empirically show that this prototype transpar- ently scales and that guiding computations by scoring as well as asyn- chronicity can greatly improve the convergence of some example algorithms.

However, these studies have often been confined to the online world, neglecting its interdependencies with the offline world. This is mainly due to the lack of real data that spans across this divide. The Live Social Semantics application is a novel platform that dissolves this divide, by collecting and integrating data about people from (a) their online social networks and tagging activities from popular social networking sites, (b) their publications and co-authorship networks from semantic repositories, and (c) their real-world face-to-face contacts with other attendees collected via a network of wearable active sensors. This paper investigates the data collected by this application during its deployment at three major conferences, where it was used by more than 400 people.

However, in the recent years, it becomes evident that one of the most important directions of improvement in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, like word sense disambiguation, coreference resolution, relation extraction, and other tasks related to knowledge extraction, is by exploiting semantics. While in the past, the unavailability of rich and complete semantic descriptions constituted a serious limitation of their applicability, nowadays, the Semantic Web made available a large amount of logically encoded information (e.g. ontologies, RDF(S)-data, linked data, etc.), which constitutes a valuable source of semantics. However, web semantics cannot be easily plugged into machine learning systems. Therefore the objective of this paper is to define a reference methodology for combining semantic information available in the web under the form of logical theories, with statistical methods for NLP. The major problems that we have to solve to implement our methodology concern (i) the selection of the correct and minimal knowledge among the large amount available in the web, (ii) the representation of uncertain knowledge, and (iii) the resolution and the encoding of the rules that combine knowledge retrieved from Semantic Web sources with semantics in the text. In order to evaluate the appropriateness of our approach, we present an application of the methodology to the problem of intra-document coreference resolution, and we show by means of some experiments on the standard dataset, how the injection of knowledge leads to the improvement of this task performance.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2010,Research Track Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

At the core of our pipeline is the algorithm called NuMi, for detecting the Number of Minimal upper bounds of any pair of elements in a given finite partial order. Our technical contribution is the coding of NuMi completely in SPARQL. To show its scalability, we applied NuMi to the entirety of SNOMED CT, the largest clinical ontology (over 300,000 conepts). Our experimental results have been groundbreaking: for the first time, all non-lattice pairs in SNOMED CT have been identified exhaustively from 34 million candidate pairs using over 2.5 billion queries issued to Virtuoso. The percentage of non-lattice pairs ranges from 0 to 1.66 among the 19 SNOMED CT hierarchies. These non-lattice pairs represent target areas for focused curation by domain experts.

If we want citizens rather than just scientists or statisticians or journalists for that matter to be able to pour over data and ask statistically sophisticated questions of comparison and contrast betewen times, places and people, does that mission re-order our research priorities at all? If the goal is to enpower citizens to be able to make use of data, what do we need to make this vision real beyond attending to Tim Berners-Lee's call to ""free your data""? The purpose of this talk therefore will be to look at key interaction issues around defining and delivering a useful, usable *data explorotron* for citizens. In particular, we'll consider who is a ""citizen user"" and what access to and tools for linked data sense making means in this case.

The goal of this paper is to provide a semantic web repository that supports applying alignments to the dataset and reasoning with alignments.

To avoid these drawbacks, this paper presents an efficient large ontology matching system Lily-LOM, which uses a non-partitioned method. Lily-LOM is based on two kinds of reduction anchors, i.e. positive and negative reduction anchors, to reduce the time complexity problem. Some empirical strategies for reducing the space complexity are also discussed.

The capabilities of the WWW as a medium for collaboration, however, are only starting to be explored. Many historical questions are only answerable by combining information from different sources, from different researchers and organizations. Furthermore, after analyzing original sources, the derived information is often more comprehensive than can be captured by simple keyword indexing.

In this demonstration we will showcase the comprehensive prosopographical knowledge base and its potential for applications. In prosopographical research, historians analyze common characteristics of historical groups by studying statistically relevant quantities of individual biographies.

Particular care is demanded in efficiently responding to the trade-off between expressivity and usefulness. The updated Web Ontology Language (OWL 2) provides dialects that are restricted in their semantic expressivity for optimizing the reasoning behavior; e.g., the OWL 2 EL or OWL 2 RL profiles. Such dialects are very important to respond to the aforementioned trade-off. Profiles reflect particular requirements and yield purposeful balance between expressivity and computational complexity.

A number of (semi-)automated alignment systems have been proposed in recent years. Most combine a set of similarity functions on lexical, semantic and structural features to align ontologies. Although these functions work well in many cases of ontology alignments, they fail to capture alignments when terms or structure varies vastly across ontologies. In this case, one is forced to rely on manual alignment. In this paper, we study whether it is feasible to re-use such expert provided ontology alignments for new alignment tasks. We focus in particular on many-to-one alignments, where the opportunity for re-use is feasible if alignments are stable. Speciﬁcally, we deﬁne the notion of a cluster as being made of multiple entities in the source ontology S that are mapped to the same entity in the target ontology T . We test the stability hypothesis that the formed clusters of source ontology are stable across alignments to different target ontologies. If this hypothesis is valid, the clusters of an ontology S, built from an existing alignment with an ontology T , can be effectively exploited to align S with a new ontology T ′ . Evaluation on both manual and automated high-quality alignments show remarkable stability of clusters across ontology alignments in the ﬁnancial domain and the healthcare and life sciences domain. Experimental evaluation also demonstrates the effectiveness of utilizing the stability of clusters in improving the alignment process in terms of precision and recall.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2011,Research Track Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

In this paper, we discuss several approaches to learning a matching function between two ontologies using a small set of manually aligned concepts, and evaluate them on different pairs of ﬁnancial accounting standards, showing that multilingual information can indeed improve the matching quality, even in cross-lingual scenarios. In addition to this, as current research on ontology matching does not make a satisfactory distinction between multilingual and cross-lingual ontology matching, we provide precise deﬁnitions of these terms in relation to monolingual ontology matching, and quantify their effects on different matching algorithms.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2011,Research Track Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

Second, because blocking operators are usually implemented, endpoint query engines are not able to incrementally produce results, and may become blocked if data sources stop sending data.

ANAPSID provides physical SPARQL operators that detect when a source becomes blocked or data tra ﬃc is bursty, and opportunistically, the operators produce results as quickly as data arrives from the sources.

Linked Stream Data consists of data generated by stream sources, e.g., sensors, enriched with semantic descriptions, following the standards proposed for Linked Data. This enables the integration of stream data with Linked Data collections and facilitates a wide range of novel applications. Currently available systems use a “black box” approach which delegates the processing to other engines such as stream/event processing engines and SPARQL query processors by translating to their provided languages. As the experimental results described in this paper show, the need for query translation and data transformation, as well as the lack of full control over the query execution, pose major drawbacks in terms of efﬁciency. To remedy these drawbacks, we present CQELS (Continuous Query Evaluation over Linked Streams ), a native and adaptive query processor for uniﬁed query processing over Linked Stream Data and Linked Data. In contrast to the existing systems, CQELS uses a “white box” approach and implements the required query operators natively to avoid the overhead and limitations of closed system regimes. CQELS provides a ﬂexible query execution framework with the query processor dynamically adapting to the changes in the input data. During query execution, it continuously reorders operators according to some heuristics to achieve improved query execution in terms of delay and complexity. Moreover, external disk access on large Linked Data collections is reduced with the use of data encoding and caching of intermediate query results. To demonstrate the efﬁciency of our approach, we present extensive experimental performance evaluations in terms of query execution time, under varied query types, dataset sizes, and number of parallel queries. These results show that CQELS outperforms related approaches by orders of magnitude.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2011,Research Track Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

These issues are particularly problematic for non-expert users, who rely on effective tool support to abstract from representational details and to be able to make sense of the contents and the structure of ontologies. To address these issues, we have developed a novel solution for visualizing and navigating ontologies, <i>KC-Viz,</i> which exploits an empirically-validated ontology summarization method, both to provide concise views of large ontologies, and also to support a ‘middle-out’ ontology navigation approach, starting from the most information-rich nodes (<i>key concepts</i>). In this paper we present the main features of KC-Viz and also discuss the encouraging results derived from a preliminary empirical evaluation, which suggest that the use of KC-Viz provides performance advantages to users tackling realistic browsing and visualization tasks. Supplementary data gathered through questionnaires also convey additional interesting findings, including evidence that prior experience in ontology engineering affects not just objective performance in ontology engineering tasks but also subjective views on the usability of ontology engineering tools.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2011,Research Track Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

We then integrate domain data from different authoritative sources and multiple regulation ontologies (capturing federal as well as state guidelines) to enable pollution detection and monitoring. An OWL-based reasoning scheme identifies pollution events relative to user chosen regulations. Our approach captures and leverages provenance to enable transparency. In addition, SemantEco features provenance-based facet generation, query answering, and validation over the integrated data via SPARQL.

We select candidate instance pairs by computing a character-level similarity on discriminating literal values that are chosen using domain-independent unsupervised learning. We index the instances on the chosen predicates’ literal values to eﬃciently look up similar instances. We evaluate our approach on two RDF and three structured datasets.

A proposed solution to identify and query data in graph-based datasets is Pivoting (or set-oriented browsing ), a many-to-many graph browsing technique that allows users to navigate the graph by starting from a set of instances followed by navigation through common links. Relying solely on navigation, however, makes it diﬃcult for users to ﬁnd paths or even see if the element of interest is in the graph when the points of interest may be many vertices apart. Further challenges include ﬁnding paths which require combinations of forward and backward links in order to make the necessary connections which further adds to the complexity of pivoting. In order to mitigate the effects of these problems and enhance the strengths of pivoting we present a multi-pivot approach which we embodied in tool called Visor. Visor allows users to explore from multiple points in the graph, helping users connect key points of interest in the graph on the conceptual level, visually occluding the remainder parts of the graph, thus helping create a road-map for navigation.

This formalism provides rigor to cyber tests to ensure that knowledge can be shared and experiment results can be viewed with confidence, knowing exactly what was tested under what conditions. The Cyber Scientific Test Language (CSTL) is an ontology-based language to describe CSM experiments. CSTL descriptions encompass test objectives, statistical experiment design, test network composition, sensor placement, and data analysis and visualization. CSTL expresses information about CSM experiments throughout their lifecycle, from initial test design through detailed test network description, instrumentation and control network augmentation, testbed buildout, data collection, and final analysis. The detailed representation of this information in a formal ontology has several benefits. It supports the use of general-purpose reasoners to query and recombine test specifications to support rapidly building an experiment network and testbed on the range. Additionally, it facilitates knowledge management and retrieval of test procedures and results. Test specifications can be viewed either with custom tools or with general-purpose applications.

It is thus evident that the performance of those stores is mission critical for individual projects as well as for data integration on the Data Web in general. Consequently, it is of central importance during the implementation of any of these applications to have a clear picture of the weaknesses and strengths of current triple store implementations. In this paper, we propose a generic SPARQL benchmark creation procedure, which we apply to the DBpedia knowledge base. Previous approaches often compared relational and triple stores and, thus, settled on measuring performance against a relational database which had been converted to RDF by using SQL-like queries. In contrast to those approaches, our benchmark is based on queries that were actually issued by humans and applications against existing RDF data not resembling a relational schema. Our generic procedure for benchmark creation is based on query-log mining, clustering and SPARQL feature analysis. We argue that a pure SPARQL benchmark is more useful to compare existing triple stores and provide results for the popular triple store implementations Virtuoso, Sesame, Jena-TDB, and BigOWLIM. The subsequent comparison of our results with other benchmark results indicates that the performance of triple stores is by far less homogeneous than suggested by previous benchmarks. 1",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2011,Research Track Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

One example of such event can be a keynote speech held at a conference, where, given a stable network connection, media content is published on social networks while the event is still going on.In our thesis, we develop a framework for media content processing, leveraging social networks, utilizing the Web of Data and fine-grained media content addressing schemes like Media Fragments URIs to provide a scalable and sophisticated solution to realize the above use cases: media content summaries and compilations. We evaluate our approach on the entity level against social media platform APIs in conjunction with Linked (Open) Data sources, comparing the current manual approaches against our semi-automated approach. Our proposed framework can be used as an extension for existing video platforms.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2011,Doctoral Consortium Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

This is fostered by a growing amount of publicly available geospatial data like OpenStreetMap. However, the integration can lead to geographic inconsistencies when combining multiple knowledge bases. Having the integration in place, users might not just issue a points-of-interest search, but rather might be interested in regions with speciﬁc attributes assigned to them. Though, having large amounts of spatial data available, standard databases and reasoners do not provide the means for (quantitative) spatial queries, or struggle to answer them efﬁciently. We seek to combine spatial reasoning, (nonmonotonic) logic programming, and ontologies for integrating geospatial databases with Semantic Web technologies. The focus of our investigation will be on a modular design, on efﬁcient processing of large amounts of spatial data, and on enabling default reasoning. We propose a two-tier design related to HEX-programs, which should lead to a plausible trade-off between modularity and efﬁciency. Furthermore, we consider suitable geo-ontologies to semantically annotate and link different sources. Finally, the ﬁndings should lead to a proof-of-concept implementation, which will be tested for efﬁciency and modularity in artiﬁcial and real-world use cases. Background and Problem Statement Fostered by a popular demand for location-aware search applications, linking and querying spatial data has become an active research ﬁeld. At the same time, governments open up their ofﬁcial datasets for public use, and collaborative projects like OpenStreetMap (OSM) are becoming large sources of spatial data (http://www.openstreetmap.org/). In this context, geospatial databases are the backbone for storing and querying these data. Hence they have been extensively studied by the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) community (cf. [9, 18]). Geospatial databases often have the drawback that querying them is complicated, inference mechanisms are virtually non-existent, and extending them is difﬁcult. In response, Semantic Web technologies are becoming more interleaved with geospatial databases [5, 24], which should lead to an easier integration and querying of spatial Supported by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) project P828897, the Marie Curie action IRSES under Grant No. 24761 (Net2), and the EC project OntoRule (IST-2009-231875).",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2011,Doctoral Consortium Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

We analyze various aspects of the resulting structures, and discuss their implications on applications of ontologies. In particular, we describe and investigate the usage of these ontology decompositions to extract modules, for instance, to facilitate matchmaking of semantic Web services in SSWAP (Simple Semantic Web Architecture and Protocol). Descriptions of those services use terms from BioPortal so service discovery requires reasoning with respect to relevant fragments of ontologies (i.e., modules). We present a novel algorithm for extracting modules from decomposed BioPortal ontologies which is able to quickly identify atoms that need to be included in a module to ensure logically complete reasoning. Compared to existing module extraction algorithms, it has a number of beneﬁts, including improved performance and the possibility to avoid loading the entire ontology into memory.

Because of the ambiguity of keyword queries, it is often not possible to generate a unique interpretation for a keyword query. Consequently, heuristics geared toward generating the top-K likeliest user-intended interpretations have been proposed. However, heuristics currently proposed fail to capture any userdependent characteristics, but rather depend on database-dependent properties such as occurrence frequency of subgraph pattern connecting keywords. This leads to the problem of generating top-K interpretations that are not aligned with user intentions. In this paper, we propose a contextaware approach for keyword query interpretation that personalizes the interpretation process based on a user’s query context. Our approach addresses the novel problem of using a sequence of structured queries corresponding to interpretations of keyword queries in the query history as contextual information for biasing the interpretation of a new query.

We propose that the degree to which a triple deviates from similar triples can be an important heuristic for identifying errors. Inspired by functional dependency, which has shown promise in database data quality research, we introduce value-clustered graph functional dependency to detect abnormal data in RDF graphs. To better deal with Semantic Web data, this extends the concept of functional dependency on several aspects. First, there is the issue of scale, since we must consider the whole data schema instead of being restricted to one database relation. Second, it deals with multi-valued properties without explicit value correlations as speciﬁed as tuples in databases. Third, it uses clustering to consider classes of values. Focusing on these characteristics, we propose a number of heuristics and algorithms to eﬃciently discover the extended dependencies and use them to detect abnormal data.

A common pattern is to incrementally migrate data from a legacy system to its successor by running the new system in parallel, with a data bridge in between. Existing approaches that can deployed as a data bridge in theory, restrict Semantic Web-enabled applications to read legacy data in practice, disallowing update operations completely. This paper explains how our RDB-to-RDF tool OntoAccess can be used to transition legacy systems into Semantic Web-enabled applications. By means of a case study, we exemplify how we successfully made a bridge between one of our own large-scale legacy applications and its long-term replacement. We elaborate on challenges we faced during the migration process and how we were able to overcome them.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2011,Semantic Web In Use Track Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

Such analysis can also isolate irregular entities, thus highlighting possible deviations from the initial design. The clusters we obtain can be fully described in terms of generalised axioms that offer a synthetic representation of the detected regularity.

However, the massive size and distributed nature of RDF data calls for approaches to learning from RDF data in a setting where the data can be accessed only through a query interface, e.g., the SPARQL endpoint of the RDF store. In applications where the data are subject to frequent updates, there is a need for algorithms that allow the predictive model to be incrementally updated in response to changes in the data. Furthermore, in some applications, the attributes that are relevant for speciﬁc prediction tasks are not known a priori and hence need to be discovered by the algorithm. We present an approach to learning Relational Bayesian Classiﬁers (RBCs) from RDF data that addresses such scenarios. Speciﬁcally, we show how to build RBCs from RDF data using statistical queries through the SPARQL endpoint of the RDF store. We compare the communication complexity of our algorithm with one that requires direct centralized access to the data and hence has to retrieve the entire RDF dataset from the remote location for processing. We establish the conditions under which the RBC models can be incrementally updated in response to addition or deletion of RDF data.

Bringing in information from the Web of Data automatically would take the burden of searching for information off the user.

Scientists can mine these datasets to discover patterns of annotation. While ontology alignment and integration across datasets has been explored in the context of the semantic Web, there is no current approach to mine such patterns in annotation graph datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for link prediction; it is a preliminary task when discovering more complex patterns. Our prediction is based on a complementary methodology of graph summarization (GS) and dense subgraphs (DSG). GS can exploit and summarize knowledge captured within the ontologies and in the annotation patterns. DSG uses the ontology structure, in particular the distance between CV terms, to ﬁlter the graph, and to ﬁnd promising subgraphs.

Materialization enables very eﬃcient responses at query time, but at the cost of an expensive up front closure computation, which needs to be redone every time the knowledge base changes. Backward-chaining does not need such an expensive and change-sensitive precomputation, and is therefore suitable for more frequently changing knowledge bases, but has to perform more computation at query time. Materialization has been studied extensively in the recent semantic web literature, and is now available in industrial-strength systems. In this work, we focus instead on backward-chaining, and we present an hybrid algorithm to perform eﬃcient backward-chaining reasoning on very large datasets expressed in the OWL Horst (pD∗) fragment. As a proof of concept, we have implemented a prototype called QueryPIE (Query Parallel Inference Engine), and we have tested its performance on different datasets of up to 1 billion triples. Our parallel implementation greatly reduces the reasoning complexity of a naive backward-chaining approach and returns results for single query-patterns in the order of milliseconds when running on a modest 8 machine cluster. To the best of our knowledge, QueryPIE is the ﬁrst reported backwardchaining reasoner for OWL Horst that eﬃciently scales to a billion triples.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2011,Research Track Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

Faceted search supports exploratory search, i.e., guided navigation that returns rich feedbacks to users, and prevents them to fall in dead-ends (empty results).

We introduce Query-based Faceted Search (QFS), the combination of an expressive query language and faceted search, to reconcile the two paradigms.

We consider the tightest possible approach – an exhaustive manual inspection of the acquired data. By using automated reasoning, we partially automate the process: after each expert decision, axioms that are entailed by the already approved statements are automatically approved, whereas axioms that would lead to an inconsistency are declined. Adequate axiom ranking strategies are essential in this setting to minimize the amount of expert decisions. In this paper, we present a generalization of the previously proposed ranking techniques which works well for arbitrary validity ratios – the proportion of valid statements within a dataset – whereas the previously described ranking functions were either tailored towards validity ratios of exactly 100% and 0% or were optimizing the worst case. The validity ratio – generally not known a priori – is continuously estimated over the course of the inspection process. We further employ partitioning techniques to signiﬁcantly reduce the computational e ffort. We provide an implementation supporting all these optimizations as well as featuring a user front-end for successive axiom evaluation, thereby making our proposed strategy applicable to practical scenarios. This is witnessed by our evaluation showing that the novel parameterized ranking function almost achieves the maximum possible automation and that the computation time needed for each reasoning-based, automatic decision is reduced to less than one second on average for our test dataset of over 25,000 statements.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2011,Research Track Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

Intuitively, a direct mapping is a default and automatic way to translate a relational database schema and its content to OWL and RDF. In this poster, we present a speciﬁcation, expressed in Datalog, of a direct mapping inspired by the current Direct Mapping draft of the W3C RDB2RDF Working Group.

In this paper, we propose to demonstrate DNS 3 , an extension of the current DNS service based on security mechanisms and semantic metadata. Speciﬁcally, we show how one can embed authoritative RDF triples using the current DNS protocol, and how the naming service can take advantage of the embedded semantic metadata to publish authoritative information about the domains, to improve the performance of domain resolution through prefetching, and to alert end-users of probable threats when visiting potentially harmful domains.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2011,Poster/Demo Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

Among the languages speciﬁed by the W3C OWL 2 standard, OWL 2 Full is the most expressive one, and several other languages, such as RIF and SPARQL 1.1, have dependencies on OWL 2 Full, but to date no reasoner has been implemented for this language. The basic idea underlying our system is to translate the semantics speciﬁcation of OWL 2 Full and the RDF graphs representing the input ontologies into ﬁrst-order logic formulae, and to apply ﬁrst-order reasoners to this axiomatisation to perform one of the supported reasoning tasks: ontology consistency checking, entailment checking, or query answering. The paper explains the taken approach, summarizes the results of a recent evaluation of this approach, and gives an overview of the functionality, architecture and implementation of the reasoner. of OWL 2 Full is the RDF Abstract Syntax <a href=""tmpGmoDfr.html#4"">[5], </a>i.e., every RDF graph is a valid OWL 2 Full ontology. The semantics of OWL 2 Full is the OWL 2 RDF-Based Semantics <a href=""tmpGmoDfr.html#4"">[6], </a>which incorporates the semantics of RDFS and is speciﬁed like RDFS as a set of model-theoretic “semantic conditions”. The semantic conditions are given in the style of ﬁrst-order logic (FOL) formulae and provide formal meaning for certain combinations of RDF triples that represent OWL 2 language constructs. The expressivity of the semantics of OWL 2 Full is roughly comparable with that of OWL 2 DL <a href=""tmpGmoDfr.html#4"">[10], </a>but it also applies to ontologies beyond the syntactic restrictions that OWL 2 DL deﬁnes to retain computational decidability; in fact, this extended ﬂexibility renders OWL 2 Full undecidable.

The portal identifies pollution events using an OWLbased reasoning system and provides browsing facets generated from provenance data encoded using the Proof Markup Language (PML). We show how exposing these measurements and their provenance as semantic data enables them to be combined with additional external data sources to look for correlations between pollution levels and health effects seen in nearby populations.

The information about the events, the social connections and the representative media are therefore all spread and locked in amongst these services providing overall limited event coverage and no interoperability of the description.

However, the rise of the Semantic Web and the publishing of increasingly large amounts of structured and interlinked data now means that useful information is distributed across multiple sources and in a variety of formats, which cannot be easily reconciled by these search engines as it is not amenable to free text search. Hence, questions which we may wish to ask of society’s collective knowledge cannot be easily answered. For example, it is diﬃcult to see how traditional search engines could be used to locate documents in which a person born in Sheﬃeld is being quoted. In this paper, we describe GATE M´ımir which indexes not only free text, but also semantic annotations and knowledge base data. The resulting multi-paradigm index allows us to search across multiple information sources in order to answer questions which are either infeasible or impossible to answer using current web search engines. GATE M´ımir GATE M´ımir 1 is a multi-paradigm information management index and repository which can be used to index and search over text, annotations, semantic schemas (ontologies), and semantic metadata (instance data). It allows queries that arbitrarily mix full-text, structural, linguistic and semantic queries, and that can scale to gigabytes of text. We brieﬂy describe in this paper the underlying architecture; full details can be found in [1]. A GATE M´ımir index supports combinations of the following data types: Text: Support for full text search represents the most basic indexing functionality, and it is required in most (if not all) cases. In GATE M´ımir this is implemented as an MG4J 2 inverted index. Annotations: The ﬁrst step in abstracting away from plain text document content is the production of annotations. Annotations in this case are linguistic metadata associated with text snippets in the documents.

Training sentiment classiﬁers from tweets data often faces the data sparsity problem partly due to the large variety of short forms introduced to tweets because of the 140-character limit. In this work we propose using semantic smoothing to alleviate the data sparseness problem. Our approach extracts semantically hidden concepts from the training documents and then incorporates these concepts as additional features for classiﬁer training. We tested our approach using two different methods. One is shallow semantic smoothing where words are replaced with their corresponding semantic concepts; another is to interpolate the original unigram language model in the Naive Bayes (NB) classiﬁer with the generative model of words given semantic concepts. Preliminary results show that with shallow semantic smoothing the vocabulary size has been reduced by 20%. Moreover, the interpolation method improves upon shallow semantic smoothing by over 5% in sentiment classiﬁcation and slightly outperforms NB trained on unigrams only without semantic smoothing.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2011,Poster/Demo Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

Because of the interactive nature of QFS, which is diﬃcult to fully render in a research paper, we feel it is important to complement it with a demonstration of our QFS prototype, Sewelis (aka. Camelis 2). An important addition to the research paper is the extension of QFS to the guided edition of RDF bases, where suggestions are based on existing data. This paper motivates our approach, shortly presents Sewelis, and announces the program of the demonstration. Screencasts of the demonstration, as well as material (program and data) to reproduce it, are available at http://www.irisa.fr/LIS/softwares/sewelis. Motivation A challenge of the Semantic Web is to enable the largest audience to explore and edit the knowledge expressed in the Semantic Web languages, in particular RDF(S) and OWL [6]. Because of the complexity of those languages, existing tools generally make a trade-off between expressiveness, i.e., the coverage of the chosen language, and usability. At one end of the spectrum, there are SPARQL endpoints and OWL editors (e.g., Prot´ eg´ e), which allow for full expressiveness but require advanced logical and technical knowledge. At the other end, there are Web applications that completely hide technical details but have limited functionalities (e.g., RSS). In between, there are graph visualization systems (e.g., Bramble [9]) and faceted search systems (e.g., SlashFacet [5], BrowseRDF [8], gFacet [3]) that offer a ﬂexible and guided exploration of RDF graphs. However, those systems are far from covering the expressiveness of SPARQL (e.g., only paths of properties can be expressed). Concerning the edition of a RDF base, there exist tools that abstract away from the concrete syntax of formal languages, and guide users [7,2]. However, while their guiding generally takes into account language grammars and domain ontologies, it lacks of accuracy because it does not take into account the existing objects and their descriptions.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2011,Poster/Demo Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

Such ontologies, although often useful, also lead to problems when used in semantically-enabled applications. Wrong conclusions may be derived or valid conclusions may be missed. Defects in ontologies can take different forms. Syntactic defects are usually easy to find and to resolve. Defects regarding style include such things as unintended redundancy. More interesting and severe defects are the modeling defects which require domain knowledge to detect and resolve such as defects in the structure, and semantic defects such as unsatisfiable concepts and inconsistent ontologies. Further, during the recent years more and more mappings between ontologies with overlapping information have been generated, e.g. using ontology alignment systems, thereby connecting the ontologies in ontology networks. This has led to a new opportunity to deal with defects as the mappings and other ontologies in the network may be used in the debugging of a particular ontology in the network. It also has introduced a new difficulty as the mappings may not always be correct and need to be debugged themselves. In this tutorial we give an overview of current approaches for debugging semantic and structure defects in ontologies (single or in an ontology network) as well as approaches for debugging mappings.

However, to avoid the information overload, such techniques often create an over-personalization effect, i.e. users are exposed only to the content systems assume they would like. To break this ""personalization bubble"" we introduce the notion of serendipity as a performance measure for recommendation algorithms. For this, we first identify aspects from the user perspective, which can determine level and type of serendipity desired by users. Then, we propose a user model that can facilitate such user requirements, and enables serendipitous recommendations.

In order to facilitate data utilization in the Semantic Web, without compromising the freedom of people to publish their data, one critical problem is to appropriately interlink such heterogeneous data. This interlinking process can also be referred to as Entity Coreference, i.e., finding which identifiers refer to the same real world entity. This proposal will investigate algorithms to solve this entity coreference problem in the Semantic Web in several aspects. The essence of entity coreference is to compute the similarity of instance pairs. Given the diversity of domains of existing datasets, it is important that an entity coreference algorithm be able to achieve good precision and recall across domains represented in various ways. Furthermore, in order to scale to large datasets, an algorithm should be able to intelligently select what information to utilize for comparison and determine whether to compare a pair of instances to reduce the overall complexity.

QuID is a reasoner for OWL 2 QL that is based on the system Quonto and is able to deal with inconsistent ontologies. The central aspect of QuID is that it implements two different, orthogonal strategies for dealing with inconsistency: ABox repairing techniques, based on data manipulation, and consistent query answering techniques, based on query rewriting. Moreover, by exploiting the ability of Quonto to delegate the management of the ABox to a relational database system (DBMS), such techniques are potentially able to handle very large inconsistent ABoxes. For the above reasons, QuID allows for experimentally comparing the above two different strategies for inconsistency handling in the context of OWL 2 QL. We thus report on the experimental evaluation that we have conducted using QuID. Our results clearly point out that inconsistency-tolerance in OWL 2 QL ontologies is feasible in practical cases. Moreover, our evaluation singles out the different sources of complexity for the data manipulation technique and the query rewriting technique, and allows for identifying the conditions under which one method is more efficient than the other.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2012,Evaluation Track Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

Firstly, we demonstrate the use of our mobile application, which searches a plant fitting the environmental conditions obtained by the smartphone's sensors. Then, we introduce our approach of the LOD generation, and present an evaluation showing its practical effectiveness.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2012,Semantic Web In Use Track Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

These NLP graphs can be measured with Precision and Recall against a ground truth graph representing what the documents actually say. When asking conjunctive queries on NLP graphs, the Recall of the query is expected to be roughly the product of the Recall of the relations in each conjunct. Since Recall is typically less than one, conjunctive query Recall on NLP graphs degrades geometrically with the number of conjuncts. We present an approach to address this Recall problem by hypothesizing links in the graph that would improve query Recall, and then attempting to find more evidence to support them.

There is recent work that allows a user to define a linked service from an online service, which includes the specifications for consuming and producing linked data, but building such models is time consuming and requires specialized knowledge of RDF and SPARQL. This paper presents a new approach that allows domain experts to rapidly create semantic models of services by demonstration in an interactive web-based interface. First, the user provides examples of the service request URLs. Then, the system automatically proposes a service model the user can refine interactively. Finally, the system saves a service specification using a new expressive vocabulary that includes lowering and lifting rules. This approach empowers end users to rapidly model existing services and immediately use them to consume and produce linked data.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2012,Research Track Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

In this paper, we address this drawback by presenting the first Link Discovery approach with theoretical quality guarantees. In particular, we prove that given an achievable reduction ratio r, our Link Discovery approach HR3 can achieve a reduction ratio r'<=r in a metric space where distances are measured by the means of a Minkowski metric of any order p >= 2. We compare HR3 and the HYPPO algorithm implemented in LIMES 0.5 with respect to the number of comparisons they carry out. In addition, we compare our approach with the algorithms implemented in the state-of-the-art frameworks LIMES 0.5 and SILK 2.5 with respect to runtime.

However, these approaches are usually complete for instance retrieval only. This paper asks if and how such methods could also be used for computing entailed subclass relationships. Checking entailment for arbitrary OWL RL class subsumptions is co-NP-hard, but tractable rule-based reasoning is possible when restricting to subsumptions between atomic classes. Surprisingly, however, this cannot be achieved in any RDF-based rule system, i.e., the W3C calculus cannot be extended to compute all atomic class subsumptions.

First, it is often quite difficult to even determine which concepts have had their meaning altered by a change. Second, once a concept change is pinpointed, the problem of distinguishing whether the concept is directly or indirectly affected by a change has yet to be tackled. To address the first issue, various principled notions of ``semantic diff'' (based on deductive inseparability) have been proposed in the literature and shown to be computationally practical for the expressively restricted case of ELHr-terminologies. However, problems arise even for such limited logics as ALC: First, computation gets more difficult, becoming undecidable for logics such as SROIQ which underly the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Second, the presence of negation and disjunction make the standard semantic difference too sensitive to change: essentially, any logically effectual change always affects all terms in the ontology. In order to tackle these issues, we formulate the central notion of finding the minimal change set based on model inseparability, and present a method to differentiate changes which are specific to (thus directly affect) particular concept names. Subsequently we devise a series of computable approximations, and compare the variously approximated change sets over a series of versions of the NCI Thesaurus (NCIt).",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2012,Research Track Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

However, the widely-used time-decay-based approach worsens the sparsity problem because it deemphasizes old item transactions. We introduce two ideas to solve the sparsity problem. First, we divide the users' transactions into epochs i.e. time periods, and identify epochs that are dominated by interests similar to the current interests of the active user. Thus, it can eliminate dissimilar transactions while making use of similar transactions that exist in prior epochs. Second, we use a taxonomy of items to model user item transactions in each epoch. This well captures the interests of users in each epoch even if there are few transactions. It suits the situations in which the items transacted by users dynamically change over time; the semantics behind classes do not change so often while individual items often appear and disappear. Fortunately, many taxonomies are now available on the web because of the spread of the Linked Open Data vision. We can now use those to understand dynamic user interests semantically. We evaluate our method using a dataset, a music listening history, extracted from users' tweets and one containing a restaurant visit history gathered from a gourmet guide site. The results show that our method predicts user interests much more accurately than the previous time-decay-based method.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2012,Research Track Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

A static and a dynamic algorithm are presented which use these costs to find optimal or near optimal execution orders for the atoms of a query.

The problem of discovering owl:sameAs links between pairwise data sources is called instance matching. Most of the existing approaches addressing this problem rely on the quality of prior schema matching, which is not always good enough in the LOD scenario. In this paper, we propose a schema-independent instance-pair similarity metric based on several general descriptive features. We transform the instance matching problem to the binary classification problem and solve it by machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, we employ some transfer learning methods to utilize the existing owl:sameAs links in LOD to reduce the demand for labeled data. We carry out experiments on some datasets of OAEI2010.

We propose the use of state-of-the art locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) techniques to vastly improve the scalability of instance matching across multiple types.

Instead of only considering the existing concepts present in each ontology, we hypothesize new composite concepts defined as disjunctions of conjunctions of (RDF) types and value restrictions, which we call restriction classes, and generate alignments between these composite concepts. This extended concept language enables us to find more complete definitions and to even align sources that have rudimentary ontologies, such as those that are simple renderings of relational databases.

It is based on a classificational interpretation of mappings: if O1 and O2 are two ontologies used to classify a common set X , then mappings between O1 and O2 are interpreted to encode how elements of X classified in the concepts of O1 are re-classified in the concepts of O2, and weights are interpreted to measure how precise and complete re-classifications are.

Even very experienced modellers with a sophisticated grasp of reasoning algorithms do not have a good mental model of reasoner performance behaviour. Seemingly innocuous changes to an OWL ontology can degrade classification time from instantaneous to too long to wait for. Similarly, switching reasoners (e.g., to take advantage of specific features) can result in wildly different classification times. In this paper we investigate performance variability phenomena in OWL ontology, and present methods to identify subsets of an ontology which are performance-degrading for a given reasoner. When such (ideally small) subsets are removed from an ontology, and the remainder is much easier for the given reasoner to reason over, we designate them ""hot spots""?. The identification of these hot spots allows users to isolate difficult portions of the ontology in a principled and systematic way. Moreover, we devise and compare various methods for approximate reasoning and knowledge compilation based on hot spots. We verify our techniques with a select set of varyingly difficult ontology from the NCBO BioPortal, and were able to, firstly, successfully identify performance hot spots against the major freely available DL reasoners, and, secondly, significantly improve classification time using approximate reasoning based on hot spots.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2012,Research Track Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

This class of solutions promises both to facilitate the integration of research data with other relevant sources of information and also to support more intelligent forms of querying and exploration. However, an issue which has only been partially addressed is that of generating and characterizing semantically the relations that exist between research areas. This problem has been traditionally addressed by manually creating taxonomies, such as the ACM classification of research topics. However, this manual approach is inadequate for a number of reasons: these taxonomies are very coarse-grained and they do not cater for the finegrained research topics, which define the level at which typically researchers (and even more so, PhD students) operate. Moreover, they evolve slowly, and therefore they tend not to cover the most recent research trends. In addition, as we move towards a semantic characterization of these relations, there is arguably a need for a more sophisticated characterization than a homogeneous taxonomy, to reflect the different ways in which research areas can be related. In this paper we propose Klink, a new approach to i) automatically generating relations between research areas and ii) populating a bibliographic ontology, which combines both machine learning methods and external knowledge, which is drawn from a number of resources, including Google Scholar and Wikipedia.

We apply this approach to predict sentiment for three different Twitter datasets.

We also compare against an approach based on sentiment-bearing topic analysis, and find that semantic features produce better Recall and F score when classifying negative sentiment, and better Precision with lower Recall and F score in positive sentiment classification.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2012,Research Track Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

While the accuracy of automatic approaches has continuously improved, human contributions remain a key ingredient of the process: this input serves as a valuable source of domain knowledge that is used to train the algorithms and to validate and augment automatically computed alignments. In this paper, we introduce CROWDMAP, a model to acquire such human contributions via microtask crowdsourcing. For a given pair of ontologies, CROWDMAP translates the alignment problem into microtasks that address individual alignment questions, publishes the microtasks on an online labor market, and evaluates the quality of the results obtained from the crowd. We evaluated the current implementation of CROWDMAP in a series of experiments using ontologies and reference alignments from the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative and the crowdsourcing platform CrowdFlower. The experiments clearly demonstrated that the overall approach is feasible, and can improve the accuracy of existing ontology alignment solutions in a fast, scalable, and cost-effective manner.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2012,Research Track Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

The graph enhances Google search in three main ways: by disambiguation of search queries, by search log-based summarization of key facts, and by explorative search suggestions. With this paper, we suggest a fourth way of enhancing Web search: through the addition of realtime coverage of what people say about real-world entities on social networks. We report on a browser extension that seamlessly adds relevant microposts from the social networking sites Google+, Facebook, and Twitter in form of a panel to Knowledge Graph entities. In a true Linked Data fashion, we interlink detected concepts in microposts with Freebase entities, and evaluate our approach for both relevancy and usefulness.

With the popularity and wide adoption of open information extraction technology, extracting entities and relations among them from text at the Web scale is possible. In this paper, we present an approach to extract the subject individuals and the object counterparts for the relations from text and determine the most appropriate domain and range as well as the most confident dependency path patterns for the given relation based on the EM algorithm.

In addition to the domain and source ontologies, the mapping algorithm requires a SPARQL query to determine the ontology mapping. Further, the mapping algorithm is dynamic; running each time a query is processed and producing only a partial mapping sufficient to reformulate the query. This approach enables the mapping algorithm to exploit query semantics to correctly choose among ontology mappings that are indistinguishable when only the ontologies are considered. Also, the mapping associates paths with paths, instead of entities with entities. This approach simplifies query reformulation. The sys- tem achieves favorable results when compared to the algorithms developed for Clio, the best automated relational data integration system.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2012,Poster/Demo Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

Quest allows to link the vocabulary of an ontology to the content of a relational database through mapping axioms. These are then used together with the ontology to answer a SPARQL query by means of a single SQL query that is executed over the database. Quest uses highly-optimised query rewriting techniques to generate the SQL query which not only takes into account the entailments of the ontology and data, but is also 'lean' and simple so that it can be executed efficiently by any SQL engine. Quest supports commercial and open source databases, including database federation tools like Teiid to allow for Ontology Based Data Integration of relational and other sources (e.g., CSV, Excel, XML). Here we will briefly describe Quest mapping language, the query answering process and the most relevant optimisation techniques used by the system.

Unlike the traditional scientific naming system, which is based on evolutionary relationships, it emphasizes the observable features of organisms. By independently naming the descriptions composed of sets of observational features, as well as maintaining connections to scientific names, it preserves the observational data used to identify organisms. The system is designed to support a peer-review mechanism for creating new names, and uses a controlled vocabulary encoded in the Web Ontology Language to represent the observational features. A prototype of the system is currently under development in collaboration with the Mushroom Observer website. It allows users to propose new names and descriptions, provide feedback on those proposals, and ultimately have them formally approved. This effort aims at offering the mycology community a knowledge base of fungal observational features and a tool for identifying fungal observations.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2012,Poster/Demo Paper,,EOL,,,,,,

We address the issue of further optimizing the runtime of link specifications by presenting HELIOS, a runtime optimizer for Link Discovery. HELIOS comprises both a rewriter and an execution planner for link specifications. The rewriter is a sequence of fixed-point iterators for algebraic rules. The planner relies on time-efficient evaluation functions to generate execution plans for link specifications. We evaluate HELIOS on 17 specifications created by human experts and 2180 specifications generated automatically. Our evaluation shows that HELIOS is up to 300 times faster than a canonical planner.

The hypothesis is that similar drugs interact with the same targets, and similar targets interact with the same drugs. The similarities between drugs reflect a chemical semantic space, while similarities between targets reflect a genomic semantic space. In this paper, we present a novel method that combines a data mining framework for link prediction, semantic knowledge (similarities) from ontologies or semantic spaces, and an algorithmic approach to partition the edges of a heterogeneous graph that includes drug-target interaction edges, and drug-drug and target-target similarity edges. Our semantics based edge partitioning approach, semEP, has the advantages of edge based community detection which allows a node to participate in more than one cluster or community. The semEP problem is to create a minimal partitioning of the edges such that the cluster density of each subset of edges is maximal. We use semantic knowledge (similarities) to specify edge constraints, i.e., specific drug-target interaction edges that should not participate in the same cluster. Using a well-known dataset of drug-target interactions, we demonstrate the benefits of using semEP predictions to improve the performance of a range of state-of-the-art machine learning based prediction methods.

The pure declarative nature of SPARQL and the high cost of evaluation can be limiting in some scenarios. On the other hand, existing big data languages are designed mainly for tabular data and, therefore, applying them to RDF data results in verbose, unreadable, and sometimes inefficient scripts. In this paper, we introduce SYRql, a dataflow language designed to process RDF data at a large scale. SYRql blends concepts from both SPARQL and existing big data languages.

Indeed, existing SPARQL-onHadoop (MapReduce) approaches have already demonstrated very good scalability, however, query runtimes are rather slow due to the underlying batch processing framework. While this is acceptable for data-intensive queries, it is not satisfactory for the majority of SPARQL queries that are typically much more selective requiring only small subsets of the data.

Specifically, our experiments with five popular RDF data management systems show that they cannot deliver good performance uniformly across workloads.

One solution to this is to include users’ preferences for semantic (i.e. linked data) categories, however this approach is limited should a user be presented with an item for which he has not rated the semantic categories previously; so called cold-start categories. In this paper we present a method to overcome this limitation by transferring rated semantic categories in place of unrated categories through the use of vertex kernels; and incorporate this into our prior SemanticSV D++ model. We evaluated several vertex kernels and their effects on recommendation error, and empirically demonstrate the superior performance that we achieve over: (i) existing SV D and SV D++ models; and (ii) SemanticSV D++ with no transferred semantic categories.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2014,Research Track Paper,,EOL,337,87960337,,,,

In this work, we instead propose an approach which combines the outcomes of two independent outlier detection runs to get a more reliable result and to also prevent problems arising from natural outliers which are exceptional values in the dataset but nevertheless correct. Linked Data is especially suited for the application of such an idea, since it provides large amounts of data enriched with hierarchical information and also contains explicit links between instances. In a first step, we apply outlier detection methods to the property values extracted from a single repository, using a novel approach for splitting the data into relevant subsets. For the second step, we exploit owl:sameAs links for the instances to get additional property values and perform a second outlier detection on these values. Doing so allows us to confirm or reject the assessment of a wrong value.

In this paper, we study the problem of noisy type assertion detection in semantic web datasets by making use of concept disjointness relationships hidden in the datasets. We transform noisy type assertion detection into multiclass classification of pairs of type assertions which type an individual to two potential disjoint concepts. The multiclass classification is solved by Adaboost with C4.5 as the base classifier. Furthermore, we propose instance-concept compatability metrics based on instance-instance relationships and instance-concept assertions. We evaluate the approach on both synthetic datasets and DBpedia.

While some provenance models and annotation techniques for storing and querying provenance data originally developed with databases or workflows in mind transfer readily to RDF and SPARQL, these techniques do not readily adapt to describing changes in dynamic RDF datasets over time. In this paper we explore how to adapt the dynamic copypaste provenance model of Buneman et al.

The core of the Semano rule base model are rule templates called japelates and their instantiations. While Semano is generic and does not make assumptions about the document characteristics used within japelates, it provides several generic japelates that can serve as a starting point. Also, Semano provides a tool that can generate an initial rule base from an ontology. The generated rule base can be easily extended to meet the requirements of the application in question.

Collapsing the strongly connected components into single nodes yields a condensed hypergraph that comprises a representation of the atomic decomposition of the ontology. To speed up the condensation of the hypergraph, we first reduce its size by collapsing the strongly connected components of its graph fragment employing a linear time graph algorithm. This approach helps to significantly reduce the time needed for computing the atomic decomposition of an ontology.

We empirically show that the relevance of triples for sampling (a semantic notion) is influenced by the topology of the graph (purely structural), and can be determined without prior knowledge of the queries.

We propose a novel estimation approach, TopGuess, which exploits topic models as data synopsis. This way, we capture correlations between structured and unstructured data in a holistic and compact manner. We study TopGuess in a theoretical analysis and show it to guarantee a linear space complexity w.r.t. text data size.

However, alongside this growth, there is a significant increase in the availability of ontologies that can be used to describe these entities. Whereas several methods have been proposed in Semantic Search to rank entities based on a keyword query, little work has been published on search and ranking of resources in ontologies. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to propose a benchmark suite for ontology search. The benchmark suite, named CBRBench3, includes a collection of ontologies that was retrieved by crawling a seed set of ontology URIs derived from prefix.cc and a set of queries derived from a real query log from the Linked Open Vocabularies search engine. Further, it includes the results for the ideal ranking of the concepts in the ontology collection for the identified set of query terms which was established based on the opinions of ten ontology engineering experts. We compared this ideal ranking with the top-k results retrieved by eight state-of-the-art ranking algorithms that we have implemented and calculated the precision at k, the mean average precision and the discounted cumulative gain to determine the best performing ranking model. Our study shows that content-based ranking models outperform graph-based ranking models for most queries on the task of ranking concepts in ontologies. However, as the performance of the ranking models on ontologies is still far inferior to the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms on the ranking of documents based on a keyword query, we put forward four recommendations that we believe can significantly improve the accuracy of these ranking models when searching for resources in ontologies.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2014,"Replication, Benchmark, Data and Software Track Paper",,EOL,129,87970129,,,,

In contrast to the plain “Extensible Value Testing” described in the W3C Recommendations for the sparql Query Language, our approach is interoperable, that is, not dependent on the specific implementation of the endpoint being used for the query, relying instead on the implementation of the endpoint that declares and makes the function available, therefore reducing interoperability issues to one single case for which we provide an open source implementation. Further, the proposed solution for using custom functions within sparql queries is quite expressive, allowing for true higher-order functions, where functions can be assigned to variables and used as both inputs and outputs, enabling a generation of Web APIs for sparql that we call Web of Functions. The paper also shows different approaches on how our proposal can be applied to existing endpoints, including a SPARQL-to-SPARQL compiler that makes the use of call unnecessary, by exploiting nonnormative sections in the Federated Query W3C Recommendations that are currently implemented on some popular sparql engines.

Thus, an up-to-date, comprehensive and consolidated view of this information across heterogeneous personal information spaces is required. Linked Data offers various solutions for integrating personal information, but none of them comprehensively addresses the specific resource constraints of mobile devices. To address this issue, this paper presents a unified data integration framework for resourceconstrained mobile devices. Our generic, extensible framework not only provides a unified view of personal data from different personal information data spaces but also can run on a user’s mobile device without any external server. To save processing resources, we propose a data normalisation approach that can deal with ID-consolidation and ambiguity issues without complex generic reasoning. This data integration approach is based on a triple storage for Android devices with small memory footprint. We evaluate our framework with a set of experiments on different devices and show that it is able to support complex queries on large personal data sets of more than one million triples on typical mobile devices with very small memory footprint.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2014,Semantic Web In Use Track Paper,,EOL,449,87970449,,,,

The CrowdTruth approach embodied in the software captures human semantics through a pipeline of four processes: a) combining various machine processing of media in order to better understand the input content and optimize its suitability for micro-tasks, thus optimize the time and cost of the crowdsourcing process; b) providing reusable human-computing task templates to collect the maximum diversity in the human interpretation, thus collect richer human semantics; c) implementing ’disagreement metrics’, i.e. CrowdTruth metrics, to support deep analysis of the quality and semantics of the crowdsourcing data; and d) providing an interface to support data and results visualization. Instead of the traditional inter-annotator agreement, we use their disagreement as a useful signal to evaluate the data quality, ambiguity and vagueness. We demonstrate the applicability and robustness of this approach to a variety of problems across multiple domains. Moreover, we show the advantages of using open standards and the extensibility of the framework with new data modalities and annotation tasks.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2014,"Replication, Benchmark, Data and Software Track Paper",,EOL,481,87970481,,,,

Most of the missing information is available on Web pages. To access that knowledge and populate knowledge bases, information extraction methods are necessitated. The bottleneck for information extraction systems is obtaining training data to learn classifiers. In this doctoral research, we investigate how existing data in knowledge bases can be used to automatically annotate training data to learn classifiers to in turn extract more data to expand knowledge bases. We discuss our hypotheses, approach, evaluation methods and present preliminary results.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2014,Doctoral Consortium Paper,,EOL,499,87970499,,,,

Synonymy and Ambiguity are among the biggest challenges in identifying such entities. Both challenges are addressed by Entity Linking, the task of grounding entity mentions in textual documents to Knowledge Base entries. Entity Linking has been based in the use of single cross-domain Knowledge Bases as source for entities. This PhD research proposes the use of multiple Knowledge Bases for Entity Linking as a way to increase the number of entities recognized in text. The problem of Entity Linking with Multiple Knowledge Bases is addressed by using textual and Knowledge Base features as contexts for Entity Linking, Ontology Modularization to select the most relevant subset of entity entries, and Collective Inference to decide the most suitable entity entry to link with each mention.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2014,Doctoral Consortium Paper,,EOL,507,87970507,,,,

Semantic Web (SW) technologies have the potential to combine heterogeneous data sources, leveraging Linked Data principles, but traditional SW methods assume that data is more or less static, which is not the case for streams. The SW community has attempted to bring streams to a semantic level, i.e., Linked Stream Data, and a number of RDF stream processing engines have been produced [1, 4, 13, 20]. This thesis work aims at developing and evaluating techniques for creating aggregated and layered abstractions of events.

An application domain may have been modeled according to different points of view and purposes. This situation usually leads to the development of different ontologies that intuitively overlap, but that use different naming and modeling conventions. The problem of (semi-)automatically computing mappings between indepen- dently developed ontologies is usually referred to as the ontology matching prob- lem. A number of sophisticated ontology matching systems have been developed in the last years [5, 30]. These systems, however, rely on lexical and structural heuristics, and the integration of the input ontologies and the mappings may lead to many undesired logical consequences. In [13] three principles were pro- posed to minimise the number of potentially unintended consequences, namely: (i) consistency principle, the mappings should not lead to unsatisfiable classes in the integrated ontology, (ii) locality principle, the mappings should link enti- ties that have similar neighbourhoods, (iii) conservativity principle, the mappings should not introduce new semantic relationships between concepts from one of the input ontologies. Violations to these principles may hinder the usefulness of ontology mappings. Our aim is to develop effective and efficient detection and correction techniques for violations of the conservativity principle for ontology alignments.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2014,Doctoral Consortium Paper,,EOL,539,87970539,,,,
