Proceedings","Facet browsing has become popular as a user friendly inter- face to data repositories. We extend facet browsing of Semantic Web data in four ways. First, users are able to select and navigate through facets of resources of any type and to make selections based on properties of other, semantically related, types. Second, we address a disadvantage of hierarchy-based navigation by adding a keyword search interface that dynamically makes semantically relevant suggestions. Third, the inter- face of our browser, /facet, allows the inclusion of facet-specific display options that go beyond the hierarchical navigation that characterizes current facet browsing. Fourth, the browser works on any RDFS dataset without any additional configuration. These properties make /facet an ideal tool for Semantic Web developers that need a instant interface to their complete dataset. The automatic facet configuration generated by the system can then be further refined to configure it as a tool for end users. The implementation is based on current Web standards and open source software. The new functionality we provide is motivated using a scenario from the cultural heritage domain.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Michiel Hildebrand;Jacco van Ossenbruggen;Lynda Hardman,3,"http://iswc2006.semanticweb.org/items/Hildebrand2006lr.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/11926078_20",2

Proceedings","The task of automatically composing Web services involves two main composition processes, vertical and horizontal composition. Vertical composition consists of defining an appropriate combination of simple processes to perform a composition task. Horizontal composition process consists of determining the most appropriate Web service, from among a set of functionally equivalent ones for each component process. Several recent research efforts have dealt with the Web service composition problem. Nevertheless, most of them tackled only the vertical composition of Web services despite the growing trend towards functionally equivalent Web services. In an attempt to facilitate and streamline the process of horizontal composition of Web services while taking the above limitation into consideration, this work includes two main contributions. The first is a generic formalization of any Web service composition problem based on a constraint optimization problem (COP); this formalization is compatible to any Web service description language. The second contribution is an incremental user-intervention-based protocol to find the optimal composite Web service according to some predefined criteria at run-time. Our goal is i) to deal with many crucial natural features of Web services such as dynamic and distributed environment, uncertain and incomplete Web service information, etc; and ii) to allow human user intervention to enhance the solving process. Three approaches are described in this work, sequential approach, distributed approach and multi-agent approach to deal with realistic domains.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Shigeo Matsubara;Toru Ishida;Ahlem Ben Hassine,3,"http://iswc2006.semanticweb.org/items/Hassine2006qy.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/11926078_10",2

Proceedings","Automated composition of Web services or the process of forming new value added Web services is one of the most promising challenges in the semantic Web service research area. Semantics is one of the key elements for the automated composition of Web services because such a process requires rich machine-understandable descriptions of services that can be shared. Semantics enables Web service to describe their capabilities and processes, nevertheless there is still some work to be done. Indeed Web services described at functional level need a formal context to perform the automated composition of Web services. The suggested model (i.e. Causal link matrix) is a necessary starting point to apply problem-solving techniques such as regression-based search for Web service composition. The model supports a semantic context in order to find a correct, complete, consistent and optimal plan as a solution. In this paper an innovative and formal model for an AI planning-oriented composition is presented.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Alain Léger;Freddy Lécué,2,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/11926078_28,http://iswc2006.semanticweb.org/items/Lecue2006uq.pdf",2

Proceedings","With the wider use of ontologies in the Semantic Web and as part of production systems, multiple scenarios for ontology maintenance and evolution are emerging. For example, successive ontology versions can be posted on the (Semantic) Web, with users discovering the new versions serendipitously; ontology-development in a collaborative environment can be synchronous or asynchronous; managers of projects may exercise quality control, examining the changes from previous baseline versions and accepting or rejecting them before a new baseline is published, and so on.

Proceedings","Wireless connectivity and widespread diffusion of portable devices offer novel opportunities for users to share resources anywhere and anytime and to form ad-hoc coalitions. Resource access control is crucial to leverage ad-hoc collaboration. In pervasive scenarios, however, collaborating entities cannot be known in advance and resource availability frequently vary, even unpredictably, due to user/device mobility, thus complicating resource access control. Access control policies cannot be defined based on entity's identities/roles, as in traditional access control solutions, and cannot be all specified a priori to face any operative run time situation, but require continuous adjustments to adapt to the current. To address these issues, this paper advocates the adoption of novel access control policy models that follow two main design guidelines: context-awareness to control resource access on the basis of context visibility and to enable dynamic adaptation of policies depending on context changes, and semantic technologies for context/policy specification to allow high-level description and reasoning reason about context and policies. The paper describes also the implementation of these concepts in a semantic context-aware policy model that adopts ontologies and rules to express context and context-aware access control policies and to allow policy adaptation.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Alessandra Toninelli;Ora Lassila;Rebecca Montanari;Lalana Kagal,4,"http://iswc2006.semanticweb.org/items/Montanari2006fr.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/11926078_34",2

Proceedings","The ubiquitous non-semantic web includes a vast array of unstructured information such as HTML documents. The semantic web provides more structured knowledge such as hand-built ontologies and semantically aware databases. To leverage the full power of both the semantic and non-semantic portions of the web, software systems need to be able to reason over both kinds of information. Systems that use both structured and unstructured information face a significant challenge when trying to convince a user to believe their results: the sources and the kinds of reasoning that are applied to the sources are radically different in their nature and their reliability. Our work aims at explaining conclusions derived from a combination of structured and unstructured sources. We present our solution that provides an infrastructure capable of encoding justifications for conclusions in a single format. This integration provides an end-to-end description of the knowledge derivation process including access to text or HTML documents, descriptions of the analytic processes used for extraction, as well as descriptions of the ontologies and many kinds of information manipulation processes, including standard deduction. We produce unified traces of extraction and deduction processes in the Proof Markup Language (PML), an OWL-based formalism for encoding provenance for inferred information.

However, each tool currently relies on its own ad hoc mechanisms and vocabulary for specifying RDF presentation knowledge, making it difficult to share and reuse such knowledge across applications.

We introduce GINO, a guided input natural language ontology editor that allows users to edit and query ontologies in a language akin to English. It uses a small static grammar, which it dynamically extends with elements from the loaded ontologies. The usability evaluation shows that GINO is well-suited for novice users when editing ontologies.

In order to find suitable information resources from a large amount of blog entries which are published every day, we need an information filtering technique to automatically transcribe user interests to a user profile in detail. In this paper, we first classify user blog entries into service domain ontologies and extract interest ontologies that express a user's interests semantically as a hierarchy of classes according to interest weight by a top-down approach. Next, with a bottom-up approach, users modify their interest ontologies to update their interests in more detail. Furthermore, we propose a similarity measurement between ontologies considering the interest weight assigned to each class and instance. Then, we detect innovative blog entries that include concepts that the user has not thought about in the past based on the analysis of approximated ontologies of a user's interests.

In this paper, we choose the botanical domain to investigate how to use ontologies to facilitate integrating and querying information on parallel leaf shape descriptions from NL documents.

This paper aims at contributing to the alleviation of this situation by proposing ONTOCOM (ONTOlogy COst Model), a model to predict the costs arising in ontology engineering processes. We introduce a methodology to generate a cost model adapted to a particular ontology development strategy, and an inventory of cost drivers which influence the amount of effort invested in activities performed during an ontology life cycle. We further present the results of the model validation procedure, which covered an expert-driven evaluation and a statistical calibration on 36 data points collected from real-world projects. The validation revealed that ontology engineering processes have a high learning rate, indicating that the building of very large ontologies is feasible from an economic point of view.

This paper introduces OntoSyphon, an alternative that strives to more fully leverage existing ontological content while scaling to extract comparatively shallow content from millions of documents. OntoSyphon operates in an ""ontology-driven"" manner: taking any ontology as input, OntoSyphon uses the ontology to specify web searches that identify possible semantic instances, relations, and taxonomic information. Redundancy in the web, together with information from the ontology, is then used to automatically verify these candidate instances and relations, enabling OntoSyphon to operate in a fully automated, unsupervised manner.

Access control is implemented using Shibboleth to identify and authenticate users and XACML to define access control policies. The system also provides a platform for publishing scientific results. It enables users to select particular nodes within the visualized workflow and drag-and-drop them into an RDF package for publication or e-learning.

However, such scoring can only express total orders, which restricts its usefulness when several factors influence result relevance. A more flexible way to express relevance is the notion of preferences. Users state which kind of answers they 'prefer' by adding soft constraints to their queries. Current approaches in the Semantic Web offer only limited facilities for specification of scoring/result ordering. There is no common language element to express and formalize ranking and preferences. We present a comprehensive extension of SPARQL which directly supports the expression of preferences.

For them to interact successfully, they must find correspondences (mappings) between the terms used in their respective ontologies. While many proposals for matching two agent ontologies have been presented in the literature, the resulting alignment may not be satisfactory to both agents, and thus may necessitate additional negotiation to identify a mutually agreeable set of alignments. We propose an approach for supporting the creation and exchange of different arguments, that support or reject possible correspondences. Each agent can decide, according to its preferences, whether to accept or refuse a candidate correspondence. The proposed framework considers arguments and propositions that are specific to the matching task and are based on the ontology semantics. This argumentation framework relies on a formal argument manipulation schema and on an encoding of the agents' preferences between particular kinds of arguments. Whilst the former does not vary between agents, the latter depends on the interests of each agent. Thus, this approach distinguishes clearly between alignment rationales which are valid for all agents and those specific to a particular agent.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Valentina A. M.

This approach reduces the run time complexity but increases the space requirements. The main reason of this increase is the type and subclass statements in the ontology. Type statements show a significant percentage in most ontologies. Since subclass is a transitive property, derivation of other statements, in particular type statements rely on it, gives rise to cyclic repetition and an excess of inferred type statements. In brief, a major part of closure computation is deriving the type statements relying on subclass statements. In this paper, we propose a syntactic transformation that is based on novel individual grouping constructs. This transformation reduces the number of inferred type statements relying on subclass relations.

As a community, we can benefit by also recognizing and drawing from the research in these different disciplines. On the other hand, Semantic Web research also has much to contribute to these disciplines and communities. For example, the Semantic Web offers scenario that often ask for unprecedented scalability of techniques from other disciplines. Throughout the talk, I will illustrate these points through examples from disciplines such as natural language processing, databases, software engineering and automated reasoning.

There remains however a strong impetus to integrate these diverse applications -- each supporting different but related functions of clinical trial management -- at syntactic and semantic levels so as to improve clarity, consistency and correctness in specifying clinical trials, and in acquiring and analyzing clinical data. The situation becomes especially critical with the need to manage multiple clinical trials at various sites, and to facilitate meta-analyses on trials. This paper introduces a knowledge-based framework that we are building to support a suite of clinical trial management applications. Our initiative uses semantic technologies to provide a consistent basis for the applications to interoperate. We are adapting this approach to the Immune Tolerance Network (ITN), an international research consortium developing new therapeutics in immune-mediated disorders.",Semantic Web In Use Track Paper,,0,,0,Amar K.

Proceedings","Integrating relational databases is recently acknowledged as an important vision of the Semantic Web research, however there are not many well-implemented tools and not many applications that are in large-scale real use either. This paper introduces the Dartgrid which is an application development framework together with a set of semantic tools to facilitate the integration of heterogenous relational databases using semantic web technologies. For examples, DartMapping is a visualized mapping tool to help DBA in defining semantic mappings from heterogeneous relational schemas to ontologies. DartQuery is an ontology-based query interface helping user to construct semantic queries, and capable of rewriting SPARQL semantic queries to a set of SQL queries. Dart-Search is an ontology-based search engine enabling user to make full-text search over all databases and to navigate across the search results semantically. It is also enriched with a concept ranking mechanism to enable user to find more accurate and reliable results. This toolkit has been used to develop an currently in-use application for China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine (CATCM). In this application, over 70 legacy relational databases are semantically interconnected by an ontology with over 70 classes and 800 properties, providing integrated semantic-enriched query, search and navigation services to TCM communities.",Semantic Web In Use Track Paper,,0,,0,Huajun Chen;Jinmin Tang;Aining Yin;Yimin Wang;Heng Wang;Yuxin Mao;Zhaohui Wu;Chunying Zhou,8,"http://iswc2006.semanticweb.org/items/Chen2006kx.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/11926078_54",2

Proceedings","Semantic annotation is a task of annotating web pages with ontological information. The large volume of web content needs to be annotated before furthering the investigation of Semantic Web, and thus it is necessary to automate the process of annotation. Our empirical study shows that strong dependencies exist among different types of targeted instances. Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are the state-of-the-art approaches for modeling the dependencies to do better annotation. However, as information on a Web page is not necessary linearly laid-out, the previous linear-chain CRFs have their limitations in semantic annotation. This paper is concerned with the issue of semantic annotation on hierarchically dependent data (Hierarchical Semantic Annotation). To better incorporate dependencies across the hierarchically laid-out information, this paper proposes a Tree-structured Conditional Random Fields (TCRFs). Methods for performing the tasks of model-parameter estimation and annotation in TCRFs have been proposed. Experimental results indicate that the proposed TCRFs for hierarchical semantic annotation can significantly outperform the existing linear-chain CRF model.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Jie Tang;MingCai Hong;Juan-Zi Li;Bangyong Liang,4,"http://iswc2006.semanticweb.org/items/Tang2006ee.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/11926078_46",2

Proceedings","Web service composition is one of many interesting challenges facing the Semantic Web. In this paper we propose a means of performing automated Web service composition by exploiting generic procedures together with rich qualitative user preferences. To this end, we exploit the agent programming language Golog to represent our generic procedure and a first-order preference language to represent rich qualitative temporal user preferences. From these we generate Web service compositions that realize the generic procedure, satisfying the users hard constraints and optimizing for the users preferences. We prove our approach sound and optimal. Our system, GologPref, is implemented and interacting with services on the Web.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Shirin Sohrabi;Sheila A.

Proceedings","The Semantic Web is an ecosystem of interaction among computer systems. The social web is an ecosystem of conversation among people. Both are enabled by conventions for layered services and data exchange. Both are driven by human-generated content and made scalable by machine-readable data. Yet there is a popular misconception that the two worlds are alternative, opposing ideologies about how the web ought to be. Folksonomy vs. ontology. Practical vs. formalistic. Humans vs. machines. This is nonsense, and it is time to embrace a unified view. I subscribe to the vision of the Semantic Web as a substrate for collective intelligence. The best shot we have of collective intelligence in our lifetimes is large, distributed human-computer systems. The best way to get there is to harness the “people power” of the Web with the techniques of the Semantic Web. In this presentation I will show several ways that this can be, and is, happening.",Invited Talk Paper,,0,,0,Tom Gruber,1,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/11926078_84,http://iswc2006.semanticweb.org/items/keynote_gruber.pdf",2
