However, the development of semantic web software applications is not yet mainstream. Reasons for that include one (or more) of the following research issues: lack of integrated development environments (IDEs, such as Visual Studio and Eclipse), poor programming language support, lack of standard testbeds and/or benchmarks, inadequate training, and perhaps the need for curricula revision. Properly addressing these issues requires interdisciplinary skills, and the collaboration between academia and industry. The First Workshop on Programming the Semantic Web invites submissions that explore the gap between todays semantic web challenges, particularly the ones related to dealing with large amounts of data, with the lack of adequate tools. We are looking for contributions that discuss, promote and further advance the programming facet of the semantic web, including the development of new languages, extension of existing ones, and the inclusion of semantic enabled capabilities into existing IDEs.",http://iswc2012.semanticweb.org/workshops/psw12.inf.puc-rio.br,,,

Typically, such systems deal with information described in Semantic Web languages like OWL and RDF(S), and provide services such as storing, reasoning, querying, analysis, etc. There are two basic requirements for these systems. First, they have to satisfy an applications semantic requirements. Second, they must scale well in order to be of practical use. Given the sheer size and distributed nature of the Semantic Web, these requirements impose new challenges beyond those addressed by previous systems. This joint workshop consists of two tracks regarding scalability: one for knowledge base systems, and another for high-performance computing. We expect that the issue of scalability is going to challenge the Semantic Web for a long period of time and significant effort is needed in order to tackle the problem. This joint workshop seeks to bring together researchers and practitioners to share their recent ideas and progress towards building scalable systems for the Semantic Web; participants from related disciplines such as Supercomputing, and High-Performance Computing, Artificial Intelligence, Databases, Information Integration, are welcome.",http://iswc2012.semanticweb.org/workshops/SSWS_HPCSW,,,

After 10 years of mainly foundations-driven research, we now see strong indicators that Semantic Web methods are entering mainstream technology, in a number of forms. The consequent rise in commercial interest will likely have a fundamental impact on the field. Some established research results will make it into mainstream applications. Others will become obsolete. Radically new ideas will emerge. It is thus the right time for the community to contemplate the way ahead. In this workshop, we will provide an exciting forum for the discussion of the future of the Semantic Web. Researchers and practitioners from all corners of the field are invited to provide their insights and projections. The event will focus on discussions and the exchange of ideas, and will use a mix of different styles of interaction between the participants. It is always good to try to look ahead and anticipate the development of a field. For the Semantic Web, it is now particularly important because recent developments indicate that Semantic Web technologies are entering the industrial mainstream. Schema.org and the Facebook Open Graph Protocol are bringing metadata to bear on the Web large-scale. IBMs Watson and Apples Siri incorporate Semantic Technologies. Google is revamping its search approach and is going more semantic in implementing their knowledge graph. And these are just a few of the prominent examples. The commercial uptake will be a game-changer for the field. It seems that only a fraction of the research results of the past ten years are currently being picked up. It seems that shallow semantics brings added value in many, but not all, application areas. In others it seems that there are roadblocks for which deep semantics is required for added value  but current approaches are still limited. Linked Data and Big Data are popular buzzwords right now, but could they be hitting a peak on the expectation curve? If so, what is going to happen in the subsequent dive? If not, how will those areas affect the fields future? In this workshop, we intend to bring together researchers from all corners of the broader Semantic Web community, to share and discuss projections of the way ahead in Semantic Web technologies and knowledge engineering in general.",http://iswc2012.semanticweb.org/workshops/sw2022,,,

It takes the ontologies as input and determines as output an alignment, that is, a set of correspondences between the semantically related entities of those ontologies. These correspondences can be used for various tasks, such as ontology merging, data translation, query answering or navigation on the web of data. Thus, matching ontologies enables the knowledge and data expressed in the matched ontologies to interoperate.",http://iswc2012.semanticweb.org/workshops/ontology-matching,,,

We will then look at the specific tasks involved in mining sentences to extract resource description framework (RDF) triples and show the importance that each level of language analysis can play in such tasks. NLP researchers have been working on such tasks for many years and have developed many algorithms to perform part-of-speech tagging, parsing, semantic disambiguation, named entity recognition and relation extraction. We will present baseline algorithms for these tasks to show expected results from state-of-the-art research. As many algorithms use machine learning (ML) techniques, we will provide a simple introduction to the aims and general principles behind such techniques and explain why they are so important to the NLP community. We will also explore problems that arise when extracting knowledge from multiple sentences and how that is closely related to concept mapping problems, which are familiar to the semantic web community.

Their attraction is the possibility of fault-tolerant execution and elastic scaling up or down of resources based on user requirements with minimal administrative burden to users. The rapid surge in volume of available RDF data has sharpened focus on the issue of large scale processing of RDF, making RDF query processing in the cloud an important topic. RDF data processing in the cloud requires considerations about appropriate storage models and computing environments and the impact of their underlying assumptions on RDFs schema-last and join-intensive workloads. Some example considerations are the absence of indexes and statistics usually relied on by traditional query optimization techniques and the heavy materialization in runtime execution environments such as Hadoop vs. pipelined execution plans used in traditional data processing systems. This tutorial will cover RDF query processing in the cloud, particularly MapReduce execution platforms such as Hadoop.

Today, Web of Data includes different types of knowledge represented in a homogeneous form: sedimentary one (encyclopedic, cultural, linguistic, common-sense) and real-time one (news, data streams, ...). This data might be useful to interlink diverse information about users, items, and their relations and implement reasoning mechanisms that can support and improve the recommendation process.  The challenge is to investigate whether and how this large amount of wide-coverage and linked semantic knowledge can be automatically introduced into systems that perform tasks requiring human-level intelligence. Examples of such tasks include understanding a health problem in order to make a medical decision, or simply deciding which laptop to buy. Recommender systems support users exactly in those complex tasks.  The primary goal of the workshop is to showcase cutting edge research on the intersection of Semantic Technologies and Recommender Systems, by taking the best of the two worlds.

The workshops are concerned with research questions on how current Semantic Web infrastructure can and should be extended to support this vision. Ontologies and linked data vocabularies are defined often in one language only (English), with a biased semantics and a corresponding world view. An infrastructure should be in place for defining ontologies and vocabularies in multiple languages with a transparent semantics across them. Current Semantic Web representation languages (RDF, OWL, SKOS) are limited in regard of the representation of natural language semantics, leaving much of the semantics hidden in textual web content out of scope for the developing Web of Data. NLP and machine learning for Linked Data can benefit from exploiting linguistic resources such as annotated corpora, Wordnets etc. if they are themselves formally represented and linked by use of Linked Data principles. In addressing such research questions, the workshop aims at providing a forum for researchers at the intersection of NLP, multilingual information access, Linked Data and the Semantic Web to exchange ideas on realizing the Multilingual Semantic Web.",http://iswc2012.semanticweb.org/workshops/msw3,,,

Recently, tensor factorizations have emerged as a highly promising approach to machine learning on graph-structured data, showing both scalability and excellent results on benchmark data sets, while matching perfectly to the triple structure of RDF. This tutorial will provide an introduction to tensor factorizations and their applications for machine learning on graphs. By the means of concrete tasks such as link prediction we will discuss several factorization methods in-depth and also provide necessary theoretical background on tensors in general. Emphasis is put on tensor models that are of interest to Linked Data, which will include models that are able to factorize large-scale graphs with millions of entities and known facts or models that can handle the open-world assumption of Linked Data.

The workshop focuses on analysis of trends and change in formal descriptions, but also in associated raw sources of knowledge (scientific publications, unstructured or semi-structured Web content, traditional data stores, e-mail or on-line discussion threads, etc.). We are especially interested in research targeted on various states of knowledge evolution, such as (a) conflicts, (b) consolidation, (c) discovery, (d) paradigm shifts, and (e) breakthroughs. We would like to trigger a comprehensive and coherent approach to studying the process of knowledge evolution by bringing together researchers and practitioners from the following fields: (i) Data mining and knowledge discovery in dynamic resources; (ii) Ontology dynamics and versioning; (iii) Trend analysis (in multiple applications, including internet search, corpus evaluation, etc.); (iv) Natural Language Processing (evolution of terminology, language use, semantics); (v) Knowledge Representation (temporal ontologies, temporal logics, belief revision, etc.); (vi) Discourse Analysis and Philosophy of Science (the definition and understanding of what particular phases of the knowledge evolution are, and how can we delimit, identify or even trigger them).",http://iswc2012.semanticweb.org/workshops/evodyn2012,,,

In addition to material produced by professionals (e.g., maps), the public has also been encouraged to make geospatial content, including their geographical location and a record of their outdoor activities, available online. The volume of such user- generated geospatial content is constantly growing. Similarly, the amount of data extracted from the Web and published as Linked Open Data is increasing. Linked Open Data include many data sets with geospatial properties such as coordinates, feature class or topological relations. The geo-referencing of Web resources and users has given rise to various services and applications that exploit it. With the location of users being made available widely, new issues such as those pertaining to security and privacy arise. Likewise, emergency response, context sensitive user applications, and complex GIS tasks all lend themselves toward solutions that combine both the Geospatial Web and the Semantic Web. The workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners from various disciplines, as well as interested parties from industry and government, to advance the frontiers of this exciting research area.",http://iswc2012.semanticweb.org/workshops/TerraCognita,,,

The results described in these articles are often backed by large amounts of diverse data produced by complex experiments, computer simulations, and observations of physical phenomena. Because of this avalanche of data, it is increasingly hard to validate, reproduce, reuse and leverage scientific data. In addition, although publications, methods and datasets are very related, they are not easily accessible and interlinked. The notable exception is omics research where journals require deposit of sequences in databanks as a condition of publication. Even where data is discoverable and accessible, significant challenges remain in data reuse and sharing, in facilitating the necessary correlation, integration and synthesis of data across levels of theory, techniques and disciplines. In the 2nd International Workshop on Linked Science (LISC2012) we will discuss and present results of new ways of publishing, sharing and linking scientific data together, and reasoning over such data to discover interesting new links to validate research. The theme of this years workshop will focus on research addressing these issues with respect to big data. Big Data is loosely characterized by the size and/or number of individual files, the number of represented variables, a range of physical scales, a range of scientific disciplines, heterogeneous metadata and data formats, in short data that cannot easily be accessed and manipulated from a thumb-drive.",http://iswc2012.semanticweb.org/workshops/LISC2012,,,

However, applications that consume Linked Data are not yet widespread. Current approaches lack methods for seamless integration of Linked Data from multiple sources, dynamic discovery of available data and data sources, provenance and information quality assessment, application development environments, and appropriate end user interfaces. Addressing these issues requires well-founded research, including the development and investigation of concepts that can be applied in systems which consume Linked Data from the Web. Following the success of the 1st and the 2nd International Workshop on Consuming Linked Data, we organize the third edition of this workshop in order to provide a platform for discussion and work on these open research problems.

A key part of this workshop is bringing together those from industry and government as well as those from academia. In order to interact successfully in an open and heterogeneous environment, being able to dynamically and adaptively integrate data from other systems on the go is necessary. This may not be a precise process but a matter of finding a good enough understanding to allow interaction to proceed successfully. With the advent of the Web, there are massive amounts of information available online that can assist in this task, but this information is often chaotically organised, stored in a wide variety of data-formats, and difficult to interpret. The other part of this workshop (SemQuant) aims to unlock a new paradigm in Semantic Web research, and even in KR research in general, by adding a quantitative research paradigm to the traditionally predominant qualitative logic-based paradigm. This is motivated in part by the significant growth in Semantic Web data, including ontologies and Linked Data, over recent years. To efficiently manage the vast quantities of knowledge and data on the Semantic Web, we need theories and tools to address questions like: How can we measure knowledge? How are these measurements different from measurements of information? How can we efficiently store knowledge? How can we efficiently and accurately transform knowledge on noisy channels like the Web? How can we measure the quality of ontologies and other forms of knowledge? How can we determine the quality of approximate methods for inference, similarity, soundness, completeness, etc.? How can such quantitative formalization help the engineering and realization of the Semantic Web?",http://iswc2012.semanticweb.org/workshops/lhd%2Bsemquant,,,

Two most important challenges are: an expressive query language that enables the description of complex situations to be detected (considering real-time and historical data) and an efficient asynchronous retrieval mechanism for the large distributed data streams. Beside elaborating on the importance of these challenges for the real-time aware applications, in this tutorial we give an overview of existing approaches for the semantic processing of real-time streams and present a novel approach based on the recent development in two emerging research areas, Complex Event Processing, that enables an efficient in memory processing of huge real-time data and Cloud Computing, that supports an elastic storage of enormous data volumes. Two studies will be demonstrated: We will show conceptual and technical details of the public-available Platform PLAY, that realizes presented approach.

When the Semantic Web community started working over a decade ago the main question was where to get the data from. By now the question of how to process ever increasing amount of semantic/linked data has come to people's utmost attention. The goal of this panel is to shed light on the various approaches/options for Big Graph Data processing. Possible questions include: (1)Does the Semantic Web need any central infrastructures? (It's a Web, after all?) (2)Or will a handful of large single-owner infrastructures dominate the Semantic Web, just as they now dominate the current Web? (3)And if so, will such infrastructures be based on the standard relational model? (4)Or on MapReduce-centric key/value-pairs? (5)Is Google's (centralised) Knowledge Graph anathema to the Semantic *Web* ? (6)Are triplestore vendors just reinventing the old database wheels? (7)What is the role of clustered MapReduce-like solutions and where are their limits for processing semantic web data?",http://iswc2012.semanticweb.org/big-graph-data-panel,,,

Musen,,,"In the 1990s, as the World Wide Web became not only world wide but also dense and ubiquitous, workers in the artificial intelligence community were drawn to the possibility that the Web could provide the foundation for a new kind of AI.  Having survived the AI Winter of the 1980s, the opportunities that they saw in the largest, most interconnected computing platform imaginable were obviously compelling.  With the subsequent success of the Semantic Web, however, our community seems to have stopped talking about many of the issues that researchers believe led to the AI Winter in the first place: the cognitive challenges in debugging and maintaining complex systems, the drift in the meanings ascribed to symbols, the situated nature of knowledge, the fundamental difficulty of creating robust models.  These challenges are still with us; we cannot wish them away with appeals to the open-world assumption or to the law of large numbers.  Embracing these challenges will allow us to expand the scope of our science and our practice, and will help to bring us closer to the ultimate vision of the Semantic Web.",,http://iswc2012.semanticweb.org/sites/default/files/76500456.pdf,,
