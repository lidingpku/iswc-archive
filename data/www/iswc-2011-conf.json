Background and Problem Statement Fostered by a popular demand for location-aware search applications, linking and querying spatial data has become an active research \ufb01eld. At the same time, governments open up their of\ufb01cial datasets for public use, and collaborative projects like OpenStreetMap (OSM) are becoming large sources of spatial data (http://www.openstreetmap.org/). In this context, geospatial databases are the backbone for storing and querying these data. Hence they have been extensively studied by the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) community (cf. [9, 18]). Geospatial databases often have the drawback that querying them is complicated, inference mechanisms are virtually non-existent, and extending them is dif\ufb01cult. In response, Semantic Web technologies are becoming more interleaved with geospatial databases [5, 24], which should lead to an easier integration and querying of spatial Supported by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) project P828897, the Marie Curie action IRSES under Grant No. 24761 (Net2), and the EC project OntoRule (IST-2009-231875).", "author": "Patrik Schneider", "topics": "", "proceedings_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2011/proceedings-2", "cnt_topic": "0", "cnt_url": "2", "list_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-25093-4_28,http://iswc2011.semanticweb.org/fileadmin/iswc/Papers/DC_Proposals/70320353.pdf", "year": "2011", "keywords": "", "list_author": "Patrik Schneider", "cnt_author": "1", "paper_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2011/proceedings-2/paper-17", "pages": "349-356", "cnt_keyword": "0", "label_proceedings": "The Semantic Web - ISWC 2011"}, {"category": "Doctoral Consortium Paper", "link_publisher": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-25093-4_19", "link_open_access": "http://iswc2011.semanticweb.org/fileadmin/iswc/Papers/DC_Proposals/70320281.pdf", "title": "DC Proposal: Towards an ODP Quality Model", "subtitle_proceedings": "10th International Semantic Web Conference, Bonn, Germany, October 23-27, 2011, Proceedings, Part II", "abstract": "Expertise modeling has been the subject of extensive research in two main disciplines - Information Retrieval (IR) and Social Network Analysis (SNA).

This formalism provides rigor to cyber tests to ensure that knowledge can be shared and experiment results can be viewed with confidence, knowing exactly what was tested under what conditions. The Cyber Scientific Test Language (CSTL) is an ontology-based language to describe CSM experiments. CSTL descriptions encompass test objectives, statistical experiment design, test network composition, sensor placement, and data analysis and visualization. CSTL expresses information about CSM experiments throughout their lifecycle, from initial test design through detailed test network description, instrumentation and control network augmentation, testbed buildout, data collection, and final analysis. The detailed representation of this information in a formal ontology has several benefits. It supports the use of general-purpose reasoners to query and recombine test specifications to support rapidly building an experiment network and testbed on the range. Additionally, it facilitates knowledge management and retrieval of test procedures and results. Test specifications can be viewed either with custom tools or with general-purpose applications.

Existing approaches that can deployed as a data bridge in theory, restrict Semantic Web-enabled applications to read legacy data in practice, disallowing update operations completely.

However, information on our desktop is often incomplete, as it is based on our subjective view, or limited knowledge about an entity.

Connecting the desktop to the Web of Data would thus enrich and complement desktop information. Bringing in information from the Web of Data automatically would take the burden of searching for information o\ufb00 the user. In addition, connecting the two networks of data opens up the possibility of advanced personal services on the desktop.

A number of (semi-)automated alignment systems have been proposed in recent years. Most combine a set of similarity functions on lexical, semantic and structural features to align ontologies. Although these functions work well in many cases of ontology alignments, they fail to capture alignments when terms or structure varies vastly across ontologies. In this case, one is forced to rely on manual alignment. In this paper, we study whether it is feasible to re-use such expert provided ontology alignments for new alignment tasks.

If this hypothesis is valid, the clusters of an ontology S, built from an existing alignment with an ontology T , can be e\ufb00ectively exploited to align S with a new ontology T \u2032 .

Linked Stream Data consists of data generated by stream sources, e.g., sensors, enriched with semantic descriptions, following the standards proposed for Linked Data. This enables the integration of stream data with Linked Data collections and facilitates a wide range of novel applications. Currently available systems use a \u201cblack box\u201d approach which delegates the processing to other engines such as stream/event processing engines and SPARQL query processors by translating to their provided languages. As the experimental results described in this paper show, the need for query translation and data transformation, as well as the lack of full control over the query execution, pose major drawbacks in terms of ef\ufb01ciency. To remedy these drawbacks, we present CQELS (Continuous Query Evaluation over Linked Streams ), a native and adaptive query processor for uni\ufb01ed query processing over Linked Stream Data and Linked Data. In contrast to the existing systems, CQELS uses a \u201cwhite box\u201d approach and implements the required query operators natively to avoid the overhead and limitations of closed system regimes. CQELS provides a \ufb02exible query execution framework with the query processor dynamically adapting to the changes in the input data. During query execution, it continuously reorders operators according to some heuristics to achieve improved query execution in terms of delay and complexity. Moreover, external disk access on large Linked Data collections is reduced with the use of data encoding and caching of intermediate query results. To demonstrate the ef\ufb01ciency of our approach, we present extensive experimental performance evaluations in terms of query execution time, under varied query types, dataset sizes, and number of parallel queries. These results show that CQELS outperforms related approaches by orders of magnitude.", "author": "Danh Le Phuoc,Minh Dao-Tran,Josiane Xavier Parreira and Manfred Hauswirth", "topics": "", "proceedings_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2011/proceedings-1", "cnt_topic": "0", "cnt_url": "2", "list_url": "http://iswc2011.semanticweb.org/fileadmin/iswc/Papers/Research_Paper/05/70310368.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-25073-6_24", "year": "2011", "keywords": "", "list_author": "Minh Dao-Tran;Manfred Hauswirth;Danh Le Phuoc;Josiane Xavier Parreira", "cnt_author": "4", "paper_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2011/proceedings-1/paper-05", "pages": "370-388", "cnt_keyword": "0", "label_proceedings": "The Semantic Web - ISWC 2011"}, {"category": "Research Track Paper", "link_publisher": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-25073-6_30", "link_open_access": "http://iswc2011.semanticweb.org/fileadmin/iswc/Papers/Research_Paper/14/70310464.pdf", "title": "A Novel Approach to Visualizing and Navigating Ontologies", "subtitle_proceedings": "10th International Semantic Web Conference, Bonn, Germany, October 23-27, 2011, Proceedings, Part I", "abstract": "Observational studies in the literature have highlighted low levels of user satisfaction in relation to the support for ontology visualization and exploration provided by current ontology engineering tools.

To address these issues, we have developed a novel solution for visualizing and navigating ontologies, <i>KC-Viz,</i> which exploits an empirically-validated ontology summarization method, both to provide concise views of large ontologies, and also to support a \u2018middle-out\u2019 ontology navigation approach, starting from the most information-rich nodes (<i>key concepts</i>). In this paper we present the main features of KC-Viz and also discuss the encouraging results derived from a preliminary empirical evaluation, which suggest that the use of KC-Viz provides performance advantages to users tackling realistic browsing and visualization tasks. Supplementary data gathered through questionnaires also convey additional interesting findings, including evidence that prior experience in ontology engineering affects not just objective performance in ontology engineering tasks but also subjective views on the usability of ontology engineering tools.", "author": "Enrico Motta,Paul Mulholland,Silvio Peroni,Mathieu d'Aquin,Jos\u00e9 Manu\u00e9l G\u00f3mez-P\u00e9rez,Victor Mendez and Fouad Zablith", "topics": "", "proceedings_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2011/proceedings-1", "cnt_topic": "0", "cnt_url": "2", "list_url": "http://iswc2011.semanticweb.org/fileadmin/iswc/Papers/Research_Paper/14/70310464.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-25073-6_30", "year": "2011", "keywords": "", "list_author": "Enrico Motta;Jos\u00e9 Manu\u00e9l G\u00f3mez-P\u00e9rez;Paul Mulholland;Mathieu d'Aquin;Fouad Zablith;Silvio Peroni;Victor Mendez", "cnt_author": "7", "paper_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2011/proceedings-1/paper-08", "pages": "470-486", "cnt_keyword": "0", "label_proceedings": "The Semantic Web - ISWC 2011"}, {"category": "Research Track Paper", "link_publisher": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-25073-6_2", "link_open_access": "http://iswc2011.semanticweb.org/fileadmin/iswc/Papers/Research_Paper/03/70310017.pdf", "title": "ANAPSID: An Adaptive Query Processing Engine for SPARQL Endpoints", "subtitle_proceedings": "10th International Semantic Web Conference, Bonn, Germany, October 23-27, 2011, Proceedings, Part I", "abstract": "Following the design rules of Linked Data, the number of available SPARQL endpoints that support remote query processing is quickly growing; however, because of the lack of adaptivity, query executions may frequently be unsuccessful.

It is thus evident that the performance of those stores is mission critical for individual projects as well as for data integration on the Data Web in general. Consequently, it is of central importance during the implementation of any of these applications to have a clear picture of the weaknesses and strengths of current triple store implementations. In this paper, we propose a generic SPARQL benchmark creation procedure, which we apply to the DBpedia knowledge base. Previous approaches often compared relational and triple stores and, thus, settled on measuring performance against a relational database which had been converted to RDF by using SQL-like queries. In contrast to those approaches, our benchmark is based on queries that were actually issued by humans and applications against existing RDF data not resembling a relational schema. Our generic procedure for benchmark creation is based on query-log mining, clustering and SPARQL feature analysis. We argue that a pure SPARQL benchmark is more useful to compare existing triple stores and provide results for the popular triple store implementations Virtuoso, Sesame, Jena-TDB, and BigOWLIM. The subsequent comparison of our results with other benchmark results indicates that the performance of triple stores is by far less homogeneous than suggested by previous benchmarks. 1", "author": "Mohamed Morsey,Jens Lehmann,S\u00f6ren Auer and Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo", "topics": "", "proceedings_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2011/proceedings-1", "cnt_topic": "0", "cnt_url": "2", "list_url": "http://iswc2011.semanticweb.org/fileadmin/iswc/Papers/Research_Paper/03/70310448.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-25073-6_29", "year": "2011", "keywords": "", "list_author": "S\u00f6ren Auer;Mohamed Morsey;Jens Lehmann;Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo", "cnt_author": "4", "paper_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2011/proceedings-1/paper-13", "pages": "454-469", "cnt_keyword": "0", "label_proceedings": "The Semantic Web - ISWC 2011"}, {"category": "Research Track Paper", "link_publisher": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-25073-6_9", "link_open_access": "http://iswc2011.semanticweb.org/fileadmin/iswc/Papers/Research_Paper/11/70310129.pdf", "title": "Decomposition and Modular Structure of BioPortal Ontologies", "subtitle_proceedings": "10th International Semantic Web Conference, Bonn, Germany, October 23-27, 2011, Proceedings, Part I", "abstract": "Abstract We present the \ufb01rst large scale investigation into the modular structure of a substantial collection of state-of-the-art biomedical ontologies, namely those maintained in the NCBO BioPortal repository. 5 Using the notion of Atomic Decomposition, we partition BioPortal ontologies into logically coherent subsets (atoms), which are related to each other by a notion of dependency. We analyze various aspects of the resulting structures, and discuss their implications on applications of ontologies. In particular, we describe and investigate the usage of these ontology decompositions to extract modules, for instance, to facilitate matchmaking of semantic Web services in SSWAP (Simple Semantic Web Architecture and Protocol). Descriptions of those services use terms from BioPortal so service discovery requires reasoning with respect to relevant fragments of ontologies (i.e., modules). We present a novel algorithm for extracting modules from decomposed BioPortal ontologies which is able to quickly identify atoms that need to be included in a module to ensure logically complete reasoning. Compared to existing module extraction algorithms, it has a number of bene\ufb01ts, including improved performance and the possibility to avoid loading the entire ontology into memory.

Because of the ambiguity of keyword queries, it is often not possible to generate a unique interpretation for a keyword query. Consequently, heuristics geared toward generating the top-K likeliest user-intended interpretations have been proposed. However, heuristics currently proposed fail to capture any userdependent characteristics, but rather depend on database-dependent properties such as occurrence frequency of subgraph pattern connecting keywords. This leads to the problem of generating top-K interpretations that are not aligned with user intentions. In this paper, we propose a contextaware approach for keyword query interpretation that personalizes the interpretation process based on a user\u2019s query context. Our approach addresses the novel problem of using a sequence of structured queries corresponding to interpretations of keyword queries in the query history as contextual information for biasing the interpretation of a new query. Experimental results presented over DBPedia dataset show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art technique on both e\ufb03ciency and e\ufb00ectiveness, particularly for ambiguous queries.", "author": "Haizhou Fu and Kemafor Anyanwu", "topics": "", "proceedings_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2011/proceedings-1", "cnt_topic": "0", "cnt_url": "2", "list_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-25073-6_13,http://iswc2011.semanticweb.org/fileadmin/iswc/Papers/Research_Paper/01/70310192.pdf", "year": "2011", "keywords": "", "list_author": "Haizhou Fu;Kemafor Anyanwu", "cnt_author": "2", "paper_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2011/proceedings-1/paper-17", "pages": "193-208", "cnt_keyword": "0", "label_proceedings": "The Semantic Web - ISWC 2011"}, {"category": "Research Track Paper", "link_publisher": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-25073-6_48", "link_open_access": "http://iswc2011.semanticweb.org/fileadmin/iswc/Papers/Research_Paper/03/70310752.pdf", "title": "Enabling fine-grained HTTP caching of SPARQL query results", "subtitle_proceedings": "10th International Semantic Web Conference, Bonn, Germany, October 23-27, 2011, Proceedings, Part I", "abstract": "As SPARQL endpoints are increasingly used to serve linked data, their ability to scale becomes crucial.

In particular, erroneous triples may occur due to factual errors in the original data source, the acquisition tools employed, misuse of ontologies, or errors in ontology alignment. We propose that the degree to which a triple deviates from similar triples can be an important heuristic for identifying errors. Inspired by functional dependency, which has shown promise in database data quality research, we introduce value-clustered graph functional dependency to detect abnormal data in RDF graphs. To better deal with Semantic Web data, this extends the concept of functional dependency on several aspects. First, there is the issue of scale, since we must consider the whole data schema instead of being restricted to one database relation. Second, it deals with multi-valued properties without explicit value correlations as speci\ufb01ed as tuples in databases. Third, it uses clustering to consider classes of values. Focusing on these characteristics, we propose a number of heuristics and algorithms to e\ufb03ciently discover the extended dependencies and use them to detect abnormal data.

Earlier work has tried to use MapReduce for large scale reasoning for pD \u2217 semantics and has shown promising results. In this paper, we move a step forward to consider scalable reasoning on top of semantic data under fuzzy pD \u2217 semantics (i.e., an extension of OWL pD \u2217 semantics with fuzzy vagueness). To the best of our knowledge, this is the \ufb01rst work to investigate how MapReduce can help to solve the scalability issue of fuzzy OWL reasoning. While most of the optimizations used by the existing MapReduce framework for pD \u2217 semantics are also applicable for fuzzy pD \u2217 semantics, unique challenges arise when we handle the fuzzy information. We identify these key challenges, and propose a solution for tackling each of them. Furthermore, we implement a prototype system for the evaluation purpose.

However, the massive size and distributed nature of RDF data calls for approaches to learning from RDF data in a setting where the data can be accessed only through a query interface, e.g., the SPARQL endpoint of the RDF store. In applications where the data are subject to frequent updates, there is a need for algorithms that allow the predictive model to be incrementally updated in response to changes in the data. Furthermore, in some applications, the attributes that are relevant for speci\ufb01c prediction tasks are not known a priori and hence need to be discovered by the algorithm. We present an approach to learning Relational Bayesian Classi\ufb01ers (RBCs) from RDF data that addresses such scenarios. Speci\ufb01cally, we show how to build RBCs from RDF data using statistical queries through the SPARQL endpoint of the RDF store. We compare the communication complexity of our algorithm with one that requires direct centralized access to the data and hence has to retrieve the entire RDF dataset from the remote location for processing. We establish the conditions under which the RBC models can be incrementally updated in response to addition or deletion of RDF data. We show how our approach can be extended to the setting where the attributes that are relevant for prediction are not known a priori, by selectively crawling the RDF data for attributes of interest.

While ontology alignment and integration across datasets has been explored in the context of the semantic Web, there is no current approach to mine such patterns in annotation graph datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for link prediction; it is a preliminary task when discovering more complex patterns.

We introduce Query-based Faceted Search (QFS), the combination of an expressive query language and faceted search, to reconcile the two paradigms.

We consider the tightest possible approach \u2013 an exhaustive manual inspection of the acquired data. By using automated reasoning, we partially automate the process: after each expert decision, axioms that are entailed by the already approved statements are automatically approved, whereas axioms that would lead to an inconsistency are declined. Adequate axiom ranking strategies are essential in this setting to minimize the amount of expert decisions. In this paper, we present a generalization of the previously proposed ranking techniques which works well for arbitrary validity ratios \u2013 the proportion of valid statements within a dataset \u2013 whereas the previously described ranking functions were either tailored towards validity ratios of exactly 100% and 0% or were optimizing the worst case. The validity ratio \u2013 generally not known a priori \u2013 is continuously estimated over the course of the inspection process. We further employ partitioning techniques to signi\ufb01cantly reduce the computational e \ufb00ort. We provide an implementation supporting all these optimizations as well as featuring a user front-end for successive axiom evaluation, thereby making our proposed strategy applicable to practical scenarios.

The current Web infrastructure heavily relies on the DNS service to allow endusers to access Web pages and Web data using meaningful names (like \u201cwww.verisign.com\u201d) rather than cryptic sequences of numbers (e.g., \u201c69.58.181.89\u201d). The main functionalities of the DNS have been speci\ufb01ed more than 25 years ago and have not fundamentally evolved since then. In this paper, we propose to demonstrate DNS 3 , an extension of the current DNS service based on security mechanisms and semantic metadata. Speci\ufb01cally, we show how one can embed authoritative RDF triples using the current DNS protocol, and how the naming service can take advantage of the embedded semantic metadata to publish authoritative information about the domains, to improve the performance of domain resolution through prefetching, and to alert end-users of probable threats when visiting potentially harmful domains.", "author": "Philippe Cudr\u00e9-Mauroux,Gianluca Demartini,Djellel Eddine Difallah,Ahmed Elsayed Mostafa,Vincenzo Russo and Matthew Thomas", "topics": "", "proceedings_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2011/poster-demo-proceedings", "cnt_topic": "0", "cnt_url": "1", "list_url": "http://iswc2011.semanticweb.org/fileadmin/iswc/Papers/PostersDemos/iswc11pd_submission_106.pdf", "year": "2011", "keywords": "", "list_author": "Djellel Eddine Difallah;Gianluca Demartini;Vincenzo Russo;Philippe Cudr\u00e9-Mauroux;Ahmed Elsayed Mostafa;Matthew Thomas", "cnt_author": "6", "paper_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2011/poster-demo-proceedings/paper-02", "pages": "", "cnt_keyword": "0", "label_proceedings": "Proceedings of ISWC 2011 Poster and Demo"}, {"category": "Poster/Demo Paper", "link_publisher": "", "link_open_access": "http://iswc2011.semanticweb.org/fileadmin/iswc/Papers/PostersDemos/iswc11pd_submission_04.pdf", "title": "A Personalized Mashup Using Rule-based Reasoning and Linked Data", "subtitle_proceedings": "", "abstract": "In this paper we propose an intelligent personalization service, built upon the idea of combining Linked Data with Semantic Web rules.

The basic idea underlying our system is to translate the semantics speci\ufb01cation of OWL 2 Full and the RDF graphs representing the input ontologies into \ufb01rst-order logic formulae, and to apply \ufb01rst-order reasoners to this axiomatisation to perform one of the supported reasoning tasks: ontology consistency checking, entailment checking, or query answering.

However, the rise of the Semantic Web and the publishing of increasingly large amounts of structured and interlinked data now means that useful information is distributed across multiple sources and in a variety of formats, which cannot be easily reconciled by these search engines as it is not amenable to free text search. Hence, questions which we may wish to ask of society\u2019s collective knowledge cannot be easily answered. For example, it is di\ufb03cult to see how traditional search engines could be used to locate documents in which a person born in She\ufb03eld is being quoted. In this paper, we describe GATE M\u00b4\u0131mir which indexes not only free text, but also semantic annotations and knowledge base data. The resulting multi-paradigm index allows us to search across multiple information sources in order to answer questions which are either infeasible or impossible to answer using current web search engines. GATE M\u00b4\u0131mir GATE M\u00b4\u0131mir 1 is a multi-paradigm information management index and repository which can be used to index and search over text, annotations, semantic schemas (ontologies), and semantic metadata (instance data). It allows queries that arbitrarily mix full-text, structural, linguistic and semantic queries, and that can scale to gigabytes of text. We brie\ufb02y describe in this paper the underlying architecture; full details can be found in [1]. A GATE M\u00b4\u0131mir index supports combinations of the following data types: Text: Support for full text search represents the most basic indexing functionality, and it is required in most (if not all) cases. In GATE M\u00b4\u0131mir this is implemented as an MG4J 2 inverted index. Annotations: The \ufb01rst step in abstracting away from plain text document content is the production of annotations.

Our approach extracts semantically hidden concepts from the training documents and then incorporates these concepts as additional features for classi\ufb01er training. We tested our approach using two di\ufb00erent methods. One is shallow semantic smoothing where words are replaced with their corresponding semantic concepts; another is to interpolate the original unigram language model in the Naive Bayes (NB) classi\ufb01er with the generative model of words given semantic concepts. Preliminary results show that with shallow semantic smoothing the vocabulary size has been reduced by 20%.

Because of the interactive nature of QFS, which is di\ufb03cult to fully render in a research paper, we feel it is important to complement it with a demonstration of our QFS prototype, Sewelis (aka. Camelis 2). An important addition to the research paper is the extension of QFS to the guided edition of RDF bases, where suggestions are based on existing data. This paper motivates our approach, shortly presents Sewelis, and announces the program of the demonstration. Screencasts of the demonstration, as well as material (program and data) to reproduce it, are available at http://www.irisa.fr/LIS/softwares/sewelis. Motivation A challenge of the Semantic Web is to enable the largest audience to explore and edit the knowledge expressed in the Semantic Web languages, in particular RDF(S) and OWL [6]. Because of the complexity of those languages, existing tools generally make a trade-o\ufb00 between expressiveness, i.e., the coverage of the chosen language, and usability. At one end of the spectrum, there are SPARQL endpoints and OWL editors (e.g., Prot\u00b4 eg\u00b4 e), which allow for full expressiveness but require advanced logical and technical knowledge. At the other end, there are Web applications that completely hide technical details but have limited functionalities (e.g., RSS). In between, there are graph visualization systems (e.g., Bramble [9]) and faceted search systems (e.g., SlashFacet [5], BrowseRDF [8], gFacet [3]) that o\ufb00er a \ufb02exible and guided exploration of RDF graphs. However, those systems are far from covering the expressiveness of SPARQL (e.g., only paths of properties can be expressed). Concerning the edition of a RDF base, there exist tools that abstract away from the concrete syntax of formal languages, and guide users [7,2]. However, while their guiding generally takes into account language grammars and domain ontologies, it lacks of accuracy because it does not take into account the existing objects and their descriptions.", "author": "Sebastien Ferre and Alice Hermann", "topics": "", "proceedings_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2011/poster-demo-proceedings", "cnt_topic": "0", "cnt_url": "1", "list_url": "http://iswc2011.semanticweb.org/fileadmin/iswc/Papers/PostersDemos/iswc11pd_submission_18.pdf", "year": "2011", "keywords": "", "list_author": "Alice Hermann;S\u00e9bastien Ferr\u00e9", "cnt_author": "2", "paper_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2011/poster-demo-proceedings/paper-53", "pages": "", "cnt_keyword": "0", "label_proceedings": "Proceedings of ISWC 2011 Poster and Demo"}, {"category": "Poster/Demo Paper", "link_publisher": "", "link_open_access": "http://iswc2011.semanticweb.org/fileadmin/iswc/Papers/PostersDemos/iswc11pd_submission_31.pdf", "title": "Synth \u2013 Linked Data Application Implementation Environment", "subtitle_proceedings": "", "abstract": "In this demo, we present Synth, a new development environment to implement Linked Data applications.

Such ontologies, although often useful, also lead to problems when used in semantically-enabled applications. Wrong conclusions may be derived or valid conclusions may be missed. Defects in ontologies can take different forms. Syntactic defects are usually easy to find and to resolve. Defects regarding style include such things as unintended redundancy. More interesting and severe defects are the modeling defects which require domain knowledge to detect and resolve such as defects in the structure, and semantic defects such as unsatisfiable concepts and inconsistent ontologies. Further, during the recent years more and more mappings between ontologies with overlapping information have been generated, e.g. using ontology alignment systems, thereby connecting the ontologies in ontology networks. This has led to a new opportunity to deal with defects as the mappings and other ontologies in the network may be used in the debugging of a particular ontology in the network. It also has introduced a new difficulty as the mappings may not always be correct and need to be debugged themselves. In this tutorial we give an overview of current approaches for debugging semantic and structure defects in ontologies (single or in an ontology network) as well as approaches for debugging mappings.

Following a brief introduction to Linked Data principles and publishing, we cover techniques for crawling, indexing, querying and reasoning over such data. We also highlight pragmatic issues faced when performing such tasks. Along these lines, the Scalable Integration of Linked Data tutorial series targets practitioners who wish to leverage existing Linked Data for their applications, but is also directly relevant to a wider audience hoping to learn more about Linked Data and the related standards.

Semantic Web Technology, enhanced by a massive use of open linked data, plays a crucial role in Watson. For example, linked data such as DBpedia and Geonames and triple stores such as Sesame have been used to generate candidate answers and to score them under multiple points of view such as type coercion and geographic proximity. In addition, the connection between linked data and natural language text offered by Wikipedia has been very useful to generate open domain training data for relation detection and entity recognition systems, substantially improving the NLP capabilities of the system and therefore allowing the development of a truly open domain QA system. This tutorial is focus on the Semantic Web Technology adopted by Watson and on how it fits in the general Deep QA architecture. The tutorial is structured in two parts, the first focusing on the open-domain QA challenge and the Watson architecture, the second focused on the use of semantic web technology and linked open data in Watson.

In this tutorial we will look into fundamental design issues of semantic-content authoring technology and of the applications deploying such technology in order to find out which incentives speak to people to become engaged with the Semantic Web, and to determine the ways these incentives can be transferred into technology design. We will present how methods and techniques from areas as diverse as participation management, usability engineering, mechanism design, social computing, and game mechanics can be jointly applied to analyze semantically enabled applications, and subsequently design incentives-compatible variants thereof. The discussion will be framed by three case studies on the topics of enterprise knowledge management, media and entertainment, and IT ecosystems, in which combinations of these methods and techniques has led to increased user participation in creating useful semantic descriptions of various types of digital resources text documents, images, videos and Web services and APIs. Furthermore, we will revisit the best practices and guidelines that have been at the core of an earlier version of this tutorial at the previous edition of the ISWC in 2010, following the empirical findings and insights gained during the operation of the three case studies just mentioned. These guidelines provide IT developers with a baseline to create technology and end-user applications that are not just functional, but facilitate and encourage user participation that supports the further development of the Semantic Web.
