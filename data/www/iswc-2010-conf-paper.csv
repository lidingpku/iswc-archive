The requirement of utilizing the entire web of data to answer a query has arised since the desire for the application of such ubiquitous semantic data sources. However, limited research work has been made on the query above the web of data and there is not a formal way to describe the query processing procedure. In this paper, we propose a general query processing method on the web of data, which contains three steps: data inference configuration, data discovery, result generation and ranking. Finally, we briefly represent the work already done and the future work.",Doctoral Consortium Paper,,0,,0,Xin Liu,1,http://iswc2010.semanticweb.org/pdf/383.pdf,1

Existing approaches tend to apply computational methods on semantic ontology to do knowledge mining, but it cannot perfectly make use of internal principles in TCM. When it comes to knowledge representation, we can transform this inherent knowledge into causal graphs. In this paper, we present an approach to build a TCM knowledge model with the capability of rule reasoning using OWL 2. In particular, we focused on the causal relations among syndrome and symptoms, changes between syndromes. We evaluated our approach by giving two typical use cases and implemented them using Jena, a Java framework supporting RDF, OWL, and including a rule-based inference engine. The evaluation results suggested that our approach clearly displayed the causal relations in TCM and shows a great potential in TCM knowledge mining.",Doctoral Consortium Paper,,0,,0,Peiqin Gu,1,http://iswc2010.semanticweb.org/pdf/432.pdf,1

My current work aims at extending SPARQL in two distinct ways: (i) to allow a better integration of RDF and XML; and (ii) to define a query language for RDF extended with domain specific annotations. Transforming data between XML and RDF is a much required, but not so simple, task in the Semantic Web. The aim of (i) is to enable transparent transformations between these two representation formats, relying on a new query language called XSPARQL. On a different aspect, representing and reasoning with meta-information about RDF triples has been addressed by several proposals for representing time, trust and provenance. A common extension of RDF (and RDFS inferencing rules), capable of encompassing all these proposals, with a clearly defined semantics is much desirable. Building on top of Annotated RDF, we present such an extension and an extension of the SPARQL language capable of querying triples with annotations. An open research issue remains the possibility of unifying the two, currently independent, extensions of SPARQL.",Doctoral Consortium Paper,,0,,0,Nuno Lopes,1,http://iswc2010.semanticweb.org/pdf/442.pdf,1

But executing complex queries in these systems usually is rather slow due to the number of joins that need to be performed. In this article, we describe an indexing method using materialized SPARQL queries as indexes on RDF data sets to reduce the query processing time. We provide a formal definition of materialized SPARQL queries, a cost model to evaluate their impact on query performance, a storage scheme for the materialization, and an algorithm to find the optimal set of indexes given a query.

To achieve this goal, it is necessary for queries to return results that include knowledge, and inferred knowledge, from multiple datasets and terminologies, using the alignment information. Furthermore, ontology alignment is not an exact science, and concept matchings often involve uncertainty. The goal of this paper is to provide a semantic web repository that supports applying alignments to the dataset and reasoning with alignments. Our goal is to provide high performance queries that return results that include inference across alignment matchings, and rank results using certainty information.

In this paper, we show parallels between requirements for the (Semantic) Web and the Smart Grid. We argue that the communication architecture for the Smart Grid can be built upon existing (Semantic) Web technologies.

These situations of interest are detected by analyzing sensor data coming from a whole variety of sensors. Considering the need for immediate assistance especially in the case of safety- and health-critical situations, the detection of situations must be achieved in real-time. In this paper we propose to use Complex Event Processing (CEP) based on semantic technologies to detect typical AAL-like situations.

The capabilities of the WWW as a medium for collaboration, however, are only starting to be explored. Many historical questions are only answerable by combining information from different sources, from different researchers and organizations.

Untraceable periods of biographies can be determined on the basis of such accomplished analyses in combination with statistically examinations as well as patterns of relationships between individuals and their activities.

Particular care is demanded in efficiently responding to the trade-off between expressivity and usefulness. The updated Web Ontology Language (OWL 2) provides dialects that are restricted in their semantic expressivity for optimizing the reasoning behavior; e.g., the OWL 2 EL or OWL 2 RL profiles. Such dialects are very important to respond to the aforementioned trade-off. Profiles reflect particular requirements and yield purposeful balance between expressivity and computational complexity. The support for dialects is not only given in OWL 2, but also in the Rule Interchange Format (RIF) standards. RIF specifies formalisms for the knowl- edge exchange between different rule systems. The same applies for the WSML language that provides variants for Description Logics and rule-based reasoning. The goal remains the same, formalisms that are expressive enough to be useful, while exhibiting reasoning characteristics that can scale to the size of the Web.

In our approach,Web services are semantically described using LAV mappings in terms of generic concepts from an ontology, user requests correspond to conjunctive queries on the generic concepts and, in addition, the user may specify a set of preferences that are used to rank the possible solutions to the given request. The LAV formulation allows us to cast the service selection problem as a query rewriting problem that must consider the relationships among the concepts in the ontology and the ranks induced by the preferences. Then, building on related work, we devise an encoding of the resulting query rewriting problem as a logical theory whose models are in correspondence with the solutions of the user request, and in presence of preferences, whose best models are in correspondence with the best-ranked solutions.

In this paper, we present a new approach to performance analysis based on justifications for entailments of OWL ontologies. Justifications are minimal subsets of an ontology that are sufficient for an entailment to hold, and are commonly used to debug OWL ontologies. In JustBench, justifications form the key unit of test, which means that individual justifications are tested for correctness and reasoner performance instead of entire ontologies or random subsets. Justifications are generally small and relatively easy to analyse, which makes them very suitable for transparent analytic micro-benchmarks. Furthermore, the JustBench approach also allows us to isolate reasoner errors and inconsistent behaviour. We present the results of initial experiments using JustBench with FaCT++, HermiT, and Pellet.

Classical measures compute similarities or distances in an ontology space by directly comparing the content of ontologies. We introduce a new family of ontology measures computed in an alignment space: they evaluate the similarity between two ontologies with regard to the available alignments between them.We define two sets of such measures relying on the existence of a path between ontologies or on the ontology entities that are preserved by the alignments. The former accounts for known relations between ontologies, while the latter reflects the possibility to perform actions such as instance import or query translation.

Therefore, to expose those costs, we have synthesized a set of more representative ontologies. Secondly, in designing for scalability, how do we manage knowledge over time?

While there is existing work on detecting syntactical and structural changes in ontologies, there is still a need in analyzing and recognizing ontology changes and refactorings by a semantically comparison of ontology versions.

This confronts researchers with a conundrum: Whilst the data is available the programming models that facilitate scalability and the infrastructure to run various algorithms on the graph are missing. Some use MapReduce - a good solution for many problems. However, even some simple iterative graph algorithms do not map nicely to that programming model requiring programmers to shoehorn their problem to the MapReduce model. This paper presents the Signal/Collect programming model for synchronous and asynchronous graph algorithms. We demonstrate that this abstraction can capture the essence of many algorithms on graphs in a concise and elegant way by giving Signal/Collect adaptations of various relevant algorithms. Furthermore, we built and evaluated a prototype Signal/Collect framework that executes algorithms in our pro- gramming model. We empirically show that this prototype transpar- ently scales and that guiding computations by scoring as well as asyn- chronicity can greatly improve the convergence of some example algorithms.

In this work, we allow users to express needs in terms of simple keywords. Given the keywords, we define the problem of finding the relevant sources as the one of keyword query routing. As a solution, we present a family of summary models, which compactly represents the Web of linked data and allows to quickly find relevant sources. The proposed models capture information at different levels, representing summaries of varying granularity. They represent different trade-offs between effectiveness and efficiency.

However, in the recent years, it becomes evident that one of the most important directions of improvement in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, like word sense disambiguation, coreference resolution, relation extraction, and other tasks related to knowledge extraction, is by exploiting semantics. While in the past, the unavailability of rich and complete semantic descriptions constituted a serious limitation of their applicability, nowadays, the Semantic Web made available a large amount of logically encoded information (e.g. ontologies, RDF(S)-data, linked data, etc.), which constitutes a valuable source of semantics. However, web semantics cannot be easily plugged into machine learning systems. Therefore the objective of this paper is to define a reference methodology for combining semantic information available in the web under the form of logical theories, with statistical methods for NLP. The major problems that we have to solve to implement our methodology concern (i) the selection of the correct and minimal knowledge among the large amount available in the web, (ii) the representation of uncertain knowledge, and (iii) the resolution and the encoding of the rules that combine knowledge retrieved from Semantic Web sources with semantics in the text. In order to evaluate the appropriateness of our approach, we present an application of the methodology to the problem of intra-document coreference resolution, and we show by means of some experiments on the standard dataset, how the injection of knowledge leads to the improvement of this task performance.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Volha Bryl;Kateryna Tymoshenko;Claudio Giuliano;Luciano Serafini,4,"http://iswc2010.semanticweb.org/pdf/234.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-17746-0_6",2

It is an example of the more general task of composing business processes or component-based software. Our doctoral research endeavours to make fundamental contributions to the knowledge representation and reasoning principles underlying the task of WSC, with a particular focus on the customization of compositions with respect to individual preferences. The setting for our work is the semantic web, where the properties and functioning of services and data are described in a computer-interpretable form. In this setting we conceive of WSC as an Artificial Intelligence planning task. This enables us to bring to bear many of the theoretical and computational advances in reasoning about action and planning to the task of WSC. However, WSC goes far beyond the reaches of classical planning, presenting a number of interesting challenges that are relevant not only to WSC but to a large body of problems related to the composition of actions, programs, business processes, and services.

And I believe it will be of similar importance to the semantic web. Once you are talking about searching from billions of objects, it will be impossible to always give a single right result, no matter how intelligent the search engine is. Instead, a set of possible results will be provided for the user to choose from. Moreover, if we consider the trade-off between the system costs of generating a single right result and a set of possible results, we may choose the latter. This will naturally lead to the question of how to decide on and present the set to the user and how to evaluate the outcome. In this presentation, I will talk about some new results in the methodology and technology developed for evaluation of web search technologies and systems. As we know, the dominant method for evaluating search engines is the Cranfield paradigm, which employs a test collection to qualify the systems' performance. However, the modern search engines are much different than the traditional information retrieval systems when the Cranfield paradigm was proposed: 1. Mostmodernsearchengineshavemuchmorefeatures,suchasquery-dependent document snippets and query suggestions, and the quality of such features can affect the users' effectiveness to find out useful information; 2. The document collections used in search engines are much larger than ever, so the complete test collection that contain all query-document judgments is not available. As response to the above differences and difficulties, the evaluation based on implicit feedback is a promising alternative methodology employed in IR evaluation. With this approach, no extra human effort is required to judge the querydocument relevance. Instead, such judgments information can be automatically predicted from real users' implicit feedback data. There are three key issues in this methodology: 1. How to predict the query-document relevance and other useful features that useful to qualify the search engine performance; 2. If the complete ""judgments"" are not available, how can we efficiently collect the most critical information that can determine the system performance; 3. Because more than query-document relevance features can affect the performance, how can they integrate to be a good metric to predict the system performance. We will show a set of technologies dealing with these issues. While semantic web search may present different requirements from web search, evaluation of any search technology will be inevitable. As such, I hope the materials covered in the talk will benefit some of you in semantic web community in the future.",Invited Talk Paper,,0,,0,Jing He;Xiaoming Li,2,"http://iswc2010.semanticweb.org/pdf/901.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-17749-1_26",2

Various methods have been proposed to compute mappings between elements from different ontologies, the majority of which being based on various kinds of similarity measures. As a major shortcoming of these methods it is difficult to decode the semantics of the results achieved. In addition, in many cases they miss important mappings due to poorly developed ontology structures or dissimilar ontology designs. I propose a complementary approach making massive use of relation extraction techniques applied to broad-coverage text corpora. This approach is able to detect different types of semantic relations, dependent on the extraction techniques used.

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the current state of the internationalization (I18n) of Semantic Web technologies. Since resource identifiers play a crucial role for the Semantic Web, the internatinalization of resource identifiers is of high importance. It turns out that the prevalent resource identification mechanism on the Semantic Web, i.e. URIs, are not sufficient for an efficient internationalization of knowledge bases. Fortunately, with IRIs a standard for international resource identifiers is available, but its support needs much more penetration and homogenization in various semantic web technology stacks.

Developer simplicity is a key goal of the Open Graph protocol which has informed many of the technical design decisions. This talk will explore the motivation of the Open Graph protocol and the design decisions which went into creating it.",Invited Talk Paper,,0,,0,Austin Haugen,1,"http://iswc2010.semanticweb.org/pdf/900.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-17749-1_25",2

The temporal dimension in medical data analysis enables clinical researches on many areas, such as, disease progress, individualized treatment, and decision support. The Semantic Web provides a suitable environment to represent the temporal dimension of the clinical data and reason about them. In this paper, we introduce a Semantic-Web based framework, which provides an API for querying temporal information from clinical narratives. The framework is centered by an OWL ontology called CNTRO (Clinical Narrative Temporal Relation Ontology), and contains three major components: time normalizer, SWRL based reasoner, and OWL-DL based reasoner. We also discuss how we adopted these three components in the clinical domain, their limitations, as well as extensions that we found necessary or desirable to archive the purposes of querying time-oriented data from real-world clinical narratives.",Semantic Web In Use Track Paper,,0,,0,Wei-Qi Wei;Harold R.

The use case for this work is quality assurance in biomedical ontologies, one desirable property of which is conformance to lattice structures. At the core of our pipeline is the algorithm called NuMi, for detecting the Number of Minimal upper bounds of any pair of elements in a given finite partial order. Our technical contribution is the coding of NuMi completely in SPARQL. To show its scalability, we applied NuMi to the entirety of SNOMED CT, the largest clinical ontology (over 300,000 conepts). Our experimental results have been groundbreaking: for the first time, all non-lattice pairs in SNOMED CT have been identified exhaustively from 34 million candidate pairs using over 2.5 billion queries issued to Virtuoso. The percentage of non-lattice pairs ranges from 0 to 1.66 among the 19 SNOMED CT hierarchies. These non-lattice pairs represent target areas for focused curation by domain experts.

One of the most difficult parts of clinical trials is the recruitment of patients: many trials fail due to lack of participants. Recruitment is done by matching the eligibility criteria of trials to patient conditions. This is usually done manually, but both the large number of active trials and the lack of time available for matching keep the recruitment ratio low. In this paper we present a method, entirely based on standard semantic web technologies and tool, that allows the automatic recruitment of a patient to the available clinical trials. We use a domain specific ontology to represent data from patients' health records and we use SWRL to verify the eligibility of patients to clinical trials.",Semantic Web In Use Track Paper,,0,,0,Paolo Besana;Anita Burgun;Annabel Bourde;Oussama Zekri;Marc Cuggia,5,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-17749-1_3,http://iswc2010.semanticweb.org/pdf/419.pdf",2

By opening up data beyond the now familiar hand crafted Web 2 mash up of data about X plus geography, what are we trying to do, really? Is the goal at least in part to enable net citizens rather than only geeks the ability to pick up, explore, blend, interogate and represent data sources so that we may draw our own statistically informed conclusions about information, and thereby build new knowledge in ways not readily possible before without access to these data seas? If we want citizens rather than just scientists or statisticians or journalists for that matter to be able to pour over data and ask statistically sophisticated questions of comparison and contrast betewen times, places and people, does that mission re-order our research priorities at all? If the goal is to enpower citizens to be able to make use of data, what do we need to make this vision real beyond attending to Tim Berners-Lee's call to ""free your data""? The purpose of this talk therefore will be to look at key interaction issues around defining and delivering a useful, usable *data explorotron* for citizens. In particular, we'll consider who is a ""citizen user"" and what access to and tools for linked data sense making means in this case. From that perspective, we'll consider research issues around discovery, exploration, interrogation and representation of data for not only a single wild data source but especially for multiple wild heterogeneous data sources. I hope this talk may help frame some stepping stones towards useful and usable interaction with linked data, and look forward to input from the community to refine such a new literacy agenda further.",Invited Talk Paper,,0,,0,m. c. schraefel,1,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-17749-1_28,http://iswc2010.semanticweb.org/pdf/903.pdf",2

Health officials use ICD in all United Nations member countries to compile basic health statistics, to monitor health-related spending, and to inform policy makers. While previous revisions of ICD encoded minimal information about a disease, and were mainly published as books and tabulation lists, the creators of ICD-11 envision that it will become a multi-purpose and coherent classification ready for electronic health records. Most important, they plan to have ICD-11 applied for a much broader variety of uses than previous revisions. The new requirements entail significant changes in the way we represent disease information, as well as in the technologies and processes that we use to acquire the new content. In this paper, we describe the previous processes and technologies used for developing ICD. We then describe the requirements for the new development process and present the Semantic Web technologies that we use for ICD-11.
