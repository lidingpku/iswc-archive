Intuitively, a direct mapping is a default and automatic way to translate a relational database schema and its content to OWL and RDF. In this poster, we present a speciﬁcation, expressed in Datalog, of a direct mapping inspired by the current Direct Mapping draft of the W3C RDB2RDF Working Group.

The current Web infrastructure heavily relies on the DNS service to allow endusers to access Web pages and Web data using meaningful names (like “www.verisign.com”) rather than cryptic sequences of numbers (e.g., “69.58.181.89”). The main functionalities of the DNS have been speciﬁed more than 25 years ago and have not fundamentally evolved since then. In this paper, we propose to demonstrate DNS 3 , an extension of the current DNS service based on security mechanisms and semantic metadata. Speciﬁcally, we show how one can embed authoritative RDF triples using the current DNS protocol, and how the naming service can take advantage of the embedded semantic metadata to publish authoritative information about the domains, to improve the performance of domain resolution through prefetching, and to alert end-users of probable threats when visiting potentially harmful domains.",Poster/Demo Paper,,0,,0,Djellel Eddine Difallah;Gianluca Demartini;Vincenzo Russo;Philippe Cudré-Mauroux;Ahmed Elsayed Mostafa;Matthew Thomas,6,http://iswc2011.semanticweb.org/fileadmin/iswc/Papers/PostersDemos/iswc11pd_submission_106.pdf,1

Among the languages speciﬁed by the W3C OWL 2 standard, OWL 2 Full is the most expressive one, and several other languages, such as RIF and SPARQL 1.1, have dependencies on OWL 2 Full, but to date no reasoner has been implemented for this language. The basic idea underlying our system is to translate the semantics speciﬁcation of OWL 2 Full and the RDF graphs representing the input ontologies into ﬁrst-order logic formulae, and to apply ﬁrst-order reasoners to this axiomatisation to perform one of the supported reasoning tasks: ontology consistency checking, entailment checking, or query answering. The paper explains the taken approach, summarizes the results of a recent evaluation of this approach, and gives an overview of the functionality, architecture and implementation of the reasoner. of OWL 2 Full is the RDF Abstract Syntax <a href=""tmpGmoDfr.html#4"">[5], </a>i.e., every RDF graph is a valid OWL 2 Full ontology. The semantics of OWL 2 Full is the OWL 2 RDF-Based Semantics <a href=""tmpGmoDfr.html#4"">[6], </a>which incorporates the semantics of RDFS and is speciﬁed like RDFS as a set of model-theoretic “semantic conditions”. The semantic conditions are given in the style of ﬁrst-order logic (FOL) formulae and provide formal meaning for certain combinations of RDF triples that represent OWL 2 language constructs. The expressivity of the semantics of OWL 2 Full is roughly comparable with that of OWL 2 DL <a href=""tmpGmoDfr.html#4"">[10], </a>but it also applies to ontologies beyond the syntactic restrictions that OWL 2 DL deﬁnes to retain computational decidability; in fact, this extended ﬂexibility renders OWL 2 Full undecidable.

The portal identifies pollution events using an OWLbased reasoning system and provides browsing facets generated from provenance data encoded using the Proof Markup Language (PML).

However, the rise of the Semantic Web and the publishing of increasingly large amounts of structured and interlinked data now means that useful information is distributed across multiple sources and in a variety of formats, which cannot be easily reconciled by these search engines as it is not amenable to free text search. Hence, questions which we may wish to ask of society’s collective knowledge cannot be easily answered. For example, it is diﬃcult to see how traditional search engines could be used to locate documents in which a person born in Sheﬃeld is being quoted. In this paper, we describe GATE M´ımir which indexes not only free text, but also semantic annotations and knowledge base data. The resulting multi-paradigm index allows us to search across multiple information sources in order to answer questions which are either infeasible or impossible to answer using current web search engines. GATE M´ımir GATE M´ımir 1 is a multi-paradigm information management index and repository which can be used to index and search over text, annotations, semantic schemas (ontologies), and semantic metadata (instance data). It allows queries that arbitrarily mix full-text, structural, linguistic and semantic queries, and that can scale to gigabytes of text. We brieﬂy describe in this paper the underlying architecture; full details can be found in [1]. A GATE M´ımir index supports combinations of the following data types: Text: Support for full text search represents the most basic indexing functionality, and it is required in most (if not all) cases. In GATE M´ımir this is implemented as an MG4J 2 inverted index. Annotations: The ﬁrst step in abstracting away from plain text document content is the production of annotations. Annotations in this case are linguistic metadata associated with text snippets in the documents.

Our approach extracts semantically hidden concepts from the training documents and then incorporates these concepts as additional features for classiﬁer training. We tested our approach using two different methods. One is shallow semantic smoothing where words are replaced with their corresponding semantic concepts; another is to interpolate the original unigram language model in the Naive Bayes (NB) classiﬁer with the generative model of words given semantic concepts. Preliminary results show that with shallow semantic smoothing the vocabulary size has been reduced by 20%. Moreover, the interpolation method improves upon shallow semantic smoothing by over 5% in sentiment classiﬁcation and slightly outperforms NB trained on unigrams only without semantic smoothing.",Poster/Demo Paper,,0,,0,Harith Alani;Yulan He;Hassan Saif,3,http://iswc2011.semanticweb.org/fileadmin/iswc/Papers/PostersDemos/iswc11pd_submission_55.pdf,1

Because of the interactive nature of QFS, which is diﬃcult to fully render in a research paper, we feel it is important to complement it with a demonstration of our QFS prototype, Sewelis (aka. Camelis 2). An important addition to the research paper is the extension of QFS to the guided edition of RDF bases, where suggestions are based on existing data. This paper motivates our approach, shortly presents Sewelis, and announces the program of the demonstration. Screencasts of the demonstration, as well as material (program and data) to reproduce it, are available at http://www.irisa.fr/LIS/softwares/sewelis. Motivation A challenge of the Semantic Web is to enable the largest audience to explore and edit the knowledge expressed in the Semantic Web languages, in particular RDF(S) and OWL [6]. Because of the complexity of those languages, existing tools generally make a trade-off between expressiveness, i.e., the coverage of the chosen language, and usability. At one end of the spectrum, there are SPARQL endpoints and OWL editors (e.g., Prot´ eg´ e), which allow for full expressiveness but require advanced logical and technical knowledge. At the other end, there are Web applications that completely hide technical details but have limited functionalities (e.g., RSS). In between, there are graph visualization systems (e.g., Bramble [9]) and faceted search systems (e.g., SlashFacet [5], BrowseRDF [8], gFacet [3]) that offer a ﬂexible and guided exploration of RDF graphs. However, those systems are far from covering the expressiveness of SPARQL (e.g., only paths of properties can be expressed). Concerning the edition of a RDF base, there exist tools that abstract away from the concrete syntax of formal languages, and guide users [7,2]. However, while their guiding generally takes into account language grammars and domain ontologies, it lacks of accuracy because it does not take into account the existing objects and their descriptions.",Poster/Demo Paper,,0,,0,Alice Hermann;Sébastien Ferré,2,http://iswc2011.semanticweb.org/fileadmin/iswc/Papers/PostersDemos/iswc11pd_submission_18.pdf,1

A number of (semi-)automated alignment systems have been proposed in recent years. Most combine a set of similarity functions on lexical, semantic and structural features to align ontologies. Although these functions work well in many cases of ontology alignments, they fail to capture alignments when terms or structure varies vastly across ontologies. In this case, one is forced to rely on manual alignment. In this paper, we study whether it is feasible to re-use such expert provided ontology alignments for new alignment tasks. We focus in particular on many-to-one alignments, where the opportunity for re-use is feasible if alignments are stable. Speciﬁcally, we deﬁne the notion of a cluster as being made of multiple entities in the source ontology S that are mapped to the same entity in the target ontology T . We test the stability hypothesis that the formed clusters of source ontology are stable across alignments to different target ontologies. If this hypothesis is valid, the clusters of an ontology S, built from an existing alignment with an ontology T , can be effectively exploited to align S with a new ontology T ′ . Evaluation on both manual and automated high-quality alignments show remarkable stability of clusters across ontology alignments in the ﬁnancial domain and the healthcare and life sciences domain.

With very few exceptions, however, research in ontology matching has focused primarily on the development of monolingual matching algorithms. As more and more resources become available in more than one language, novel algorithms are required which are capable of matching ontologies which share more than one language, or ontologies which are multilingual but do not share any languages. In this paper, we discuss several approaches to learning a matching function between two ontologies using a small set of manually aligned concepts, and evaluate them on different pairs of ﬁnancial accounting standards, showing that multilingual information can indeed improve the matching quality, even in cross-lingual scenarios. In addition to this, as current research on ontology matching does not make a satisfactory distinction between multilingual and cross-lingual ontology matching, we provide precise deﬁnitions of these terms in relation to monolingual ontology matching, and quantify their effects on different matching algorithms.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Philipp Cimiano;Dennis Spohr;Laura Hollink,3,"http://iswc2011.semanticweb.org/fileadmin/iswc/Papers/Research_Paper/13/70310656.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-25073-6_42",2

Linked Stream Data consists of data generated by stream sources, e.g., sensors, enriched with semantic descriptions, following the standards proposed for Linked Data. This enables the integration of stream data with Linked Data collections and facilitates a wide range of novel applications. Currently available systems use a “black box” approach which delegates the processing to other engines such as stream/event processing engines and SPARQL query processors by translating to their provided languages. As the experimental results described in this paper show, the need for query translation and data transformation, as well as the lack of full control over the query execution, pose major drawbacks in terms of efﬁciency. To remedy these drawbacks, we present CQELS (Continuous Query Evaluation over Linked Streams ), a native and adaptive query processor for uniﬁed query processing over Linked Stream Data and Linked Data. In contrast to the existing systems, CQELS uses a “white box” approach and implements the required query operators natively to avoid the overhead and limitations of closed system regimes. CQELS provides a ﬂexible query execution framework with the query processor dynamically adapting to the changes in the input data. During query execution, it continuously reorders operators according to some heuristics to achieve improved query execution in terms of delay and complexity. Moreover, external disk access on large Linked Data collections is reduced with the use of data encoding and caching of intermediate query results. To demonstrate the efﬁciency of our approach, we present extensive experimental performance evaluations in terms of query execution time, under varied query types, dataset sizes, and number of parallel queries. These results show that CQELS outperforms related approaches by orders of magnitude.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Minh Dao-Tran;Manfred Hauswirth;Danh Le Phuoc;Josiane Xavier Parreira,4,"http://iswc2011.semanticweb.org/fileadmin/iswc/Papers/Research_Paper/05/70310368.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-25073-6_24",2

These qualities occur frequently in ecological systems, which make concepts from these systems challenging to model in formal ontology.

A proposed solution to identify and query data in graph-based datasets is Pivoting (or set-oriented browsing ), a many-to-many graph browsing technique that allows users to navigate the graph by starting from a set of instances followed by navigation through common links. Relying solely on navigation, however, makes it diﬃcult for users to ﬁnd paths or even see if the element of interest is in the graph when the points of interest may be many vertices apart. Further challenges include ﬁnding paths which require combinations of forward and backward links in order to make the necessary connections which further adds to the complexity of pivoting. In order to mitigate the effects of these problems and enhance the strengths of pivoting we present a multi-pivot approach which we embodied in tool called Visor. Visor allows users to explore from multiple points in the graph, helping users connect key points of interest in the graph on the conceptual level, visually occluding the remainder parts of the graph, thus helping create a road-map for navigation.

It is thus evident that the performance of those stores is mission critical for individual projects as well as for data integration on the Data Web in general. Consequently, it is of central importance during the implementation of any of these applications to have a clear picture of the weaknesses and strengths of current triple store implementations. In this paper, we propose a generic SPARQL benchmark creation procedure, which we apply to the DBpedia knowledge base. Previous approaches often compared relational and triple stores and, thus, settled on measuring performance against a relational database which had been converted to RDF by using SQL-like queries. In contrast to those approaches, our benchmark is based on queries that were actually issued by humans and applications against existing RDF data not resembling a relational schema. Our generic procedure for benchmark creation is based on query-log mining, clustering and SPARQL feature analysis. We argue that a pure SPARQL benchmark is more useful to compare existing triple stores and provide results for the popular triple store implementations Virtuoso, Sesame, Jena-TDB, and BigOWLIM. The subsequent comparison of our results with other benchmark results indicates that the performance of triple stores is by far less homogeneous than suggested by previous benchmarks. 1",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Sören Auer;Mohamed Morsey;Jens Lehmann;Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo,4,"http://iswc2011.semanticweb.org/fileadmin/iswc/Papers/Research_Paper/03/70310448.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-25073-6_29",2

In particular, we describe and investigate the usage of these ontology decompositions to extract modules, for instance, to facilitate matchmaking of semantic Web services in SSWAP (Simple Semantic Web Architecture and Protocol). Descriptions of those services use terms from BioPortal so service discovery requires reasoning with respect to relevant fragments of ontologies (i.e., modules). We present a novel algorithm for extracting modules from decomposed BioPortal ontologies which is able to quickly identify atoms that need to be included in a module to ensure logically complete reasoning.

Because of the ambiguity of keyword queries, it is often not possible to generate a unique interpretation for a keyword query. Consequently, heuristics geared toward generating the top-K likeliest user-intended interpretations have been proposed. However, heuristics currently proposed fail to capture any userdependent characteristics, but rather depend on database-dependent properties such as occurrence frequency of subgraph pattern connecting keywords. This leads to the problem of generating top-K interpretations that are not aligned with user intentions. In this paper, we propose a contextaware approach for keyword query interpretation that personalizes the interpretation process based on a user’s query context.

In particular, erroneous triples may occur due to factual errors in the original data source, the acquisition tools employed, misuse of ontologies, or errors in ontology alignment. We propose that the degree to which a triple deviates from similar triples can be an important heuristic for identifying errors. Inspired by functional dependency, which has shown promise in database data quality research, we introduce value-clustered graph functional dependency to detect abnormal data in RDF graphs. To better deal with Semantic Web data, this extends the concept of functional dependency on several aspects. First, there is the issue of scale, since we must consider the whole data schema instead of being restricted to one database relation. Second, it deals with multi-valued properties without explicit value correlations as speciﬁed as tuples in databases. Third, it uses clustering to consider classes of values. Focusing on these characteristics, we propose a number of heuristics and algorithms to eﬃciently discover the extended dependencies and use them to detect abnormal data.

In applications where the data are subject to frequent updates, there is a need for algorithms that allow the predictive model to be incrementally updated in response to changes in the data.

Materialization enables very eﬃcient responses at query time, but at the cost of an expensive up front closure computation, which needs to be redone every time the knowledge base changes. Backward-chaining does not need such an expensive and change-sensitive precomputation, and is therefore suitable for more frequently changing knowledge bases, but has to perform more computation at query time. Materialization has been studied extensively in the recent semantic web literature, and is now available in industrial-strength systems.

Faceted search supports exploratory search, i.e., guided navigation that returns rich feedbacks to users, and prevents them to fall in dead-ends (empty results). However, faceted search systems do not offer the same expressiveness as query languages. We introduce Query-based Faceted Search (QFS), the combination of an expressive query language and faceted search, to reconcile the two paradigms.

We consider the tightest possible approach – an exhaustive manual inspection of the acquired data. By using automated reasoning, we partially automate the process: after each expert decision, axioms that are entailed by the already approved statements are automatically approved, whereas axioms that would lead to an inconsistency are declined. Adequate axiom ranking strategies are essential in this setting to minimize the amount of expert decisions. In this paper, we present a generalization of the previously proposed ranking techniques which works well for arbitrary validity ratios – the proportion of valid statements within a dataset – whereas the previously described ranking functions were either tailored towards validity ratios of exactly 100% and 0% or were optimizing the worst case. The validity ratio – generally not known a priori – is continuously estimated over the course of the inspection process. We further employ partitioning techniques to signiﬁcantly reduce the computational e ffort.

CSTL descriptions encompass test objectives, statistical experiment design, test network composition, sensor placement, and data analysis and visualization. CSTL expresses information about CSM experiments throughout their lifecycle, from initial test design through detailed test network description, instrumentation and control network augmentation, testbed buildout, data collection, and final analysis. The detailed representation of this information in a formal ontology has several benefits. It supports the use of general-purpose reasoners to query and recombine test specifications to support rapidly building an experiment network and testbed on the range.

Common search operations, for example searching for a music clip based on artist name and song title on video platforms such as YouTube, can be achieved both based on potentially shallow human-generated metadata, or based on more profound content analysis, driven by Optical Character Recognition (OCR) or Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, more advanced use cases, such as summaries or compilations of several pieces of media content covering a certain event, are hard, if not impossible to fulfill at large scale. One example of such event can be a keynote speech held at a conference, where, given a stable network connection, media content is published on social networks while the event is still going on.In our thesis, we develop a framework for media content processing, leveraging social networks, utilizing the Web of Data and fine-grained media content addressing schemes like Media Fragments URIs to provide a scalable and sophisticated solution to realize the above use cases: media content summaries and compilations.

This is fostered by a growing amount of publicly available geospatial data like OpenStreetMap. However, the integration can lead to geographic inconsistencies when combining multiple knowledge bases. Having the integration in place, users might not just issue a points-of-interest search, but rather might be interested in regions with speciﬁc attributes assigned to them. Though, having large amounts of spatial data available, standard databases and reasoners do not provide the means for (quantitative) spatial queries, or struggle to answer them efﬁciently. We seek to combine spatial reasoning, (nonmonotonic) logic programming, and ontologies for integrating geospatial databases with Semantic Web technologies. The focus of our investigation will be on a modular design, on efﬁcient processing of large amounts of spatial data, and on enabling default reasoning. We propose a two-tier design related to HEX-programs, which should lead to a plausible trade-off between modularity and efﬁciency. Furthermore, we consider suitable geo-ontologies to semantically annotate and link different sources. Finally, the ﬁndings should lead to a proof-of-concept implementation, which will be tested for efﬁciency and modularity in artiﬁcial and real-world use cases. Background and Problem Statement Fostered by a popular demand for location-aware search applications, linking and querying spatial data has become an active research ﬁeld. At the same time, governments open up their ofﬁcial datasets for public use, and collaborative projects like OpenStreetMap (OSM) are becoming large sources of spatial data (http://www.openstreetmap.org/). In this context, geospatial databases are the backbone for storing and querying these data. Hence they have been extensively studied by the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) community (cf. [9, 18]). Geospatial databases often have the drawback that querying them is complicated, inference mechanisms are virtually non-existent, and extending them is difﬁcult. In response, Semantic Web technologies are becoming more interleaved with geospatial databases [5, 24], which should lead to an easier integration and querying of spatial Supported by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) project P828897, the Marie Curie action IRSES under Grant No. 24761 (Net2), and the EC project OntoRule (IST-2009-231875).",Doctoral Consortium Paper,,0,,0,Patrik Schneider,1,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-25093-4_28,http://iswc2011.semanticweb.org/fileadmin/iswc/Papers/DC_Proposals/70320353.pdf",2

Introducing Semantic Web technology in newly developed systems is often difficult, as these systems need to run in tandem with their predecessors and cooperatively read and update existing data. A common pattern is to incrementally migrate data from a legacy system to its successor by running the new system in parallel, with a data bridge in between. Existing approaches that can deployed as a data bridge in theory, restrict Semantic Web-enabled applications to read legacy data in practice, disallowing update operations completely.

MDS combines a trans- parent (versioned) and opaque (content-based) naming scheme for URIs of parts of legal texts, allowing for tracking of version information at the URI-level, as well as reverse engineering of versioned metadata from sources that provide only partial information, such as many web-based legal content services.

In this paper, we present Zhishi.me, the ﬁrst effort to publish large scale Chinese semantic data and link them together as a Chinese LOD (CLOD). More precisely, we identify important structural features in three largest Chinese encyclopedia sites (i.e., Baidu Baike, Hudong Baike, and Chinese Wikipedia) for extraction and propose several data-level mapping strategies for automatic link discovery. As a result, the CLOD has more than 5 million distinct entities and we simply link CLOD with the existing LOD based on the multilingual characteristic of Wikipedia.

Such ontologies, although often useful, also lead to problems when used in semantically-enabled applications. Wrong conclusions may be derived or valid conclusions may be missed. Defects in ontologies can take different forms. Syntactic defects are usually easy to find and to resolve. Defects regarding style include such things as unintended redundancy. More interesting and severe defects are the modeling defects which require domain knowledge to detect and resolve such as defects in the structure, and semantic defects such as unsatisfiable concepts and inconsistent ontologies. Further, during the recent years more and more mappings between ontologies with overlapping information have been generated, e.g. using ontology alignment systems, thereby connecting the ontologies in ontology networks. This has led to a new opportunity to deal with defects as the mappings and other ontologies in the network may be used in the debugging of a particular ontology in the network. It also has introduced a new difficulty as the mappings may not always be correct and need to be debugged themselves. In this tutorial we give an overview of current approaches for debugging semantic and structure defects in ontologies (single or in an ontology network) as well as approaches for debugging mappings.

For example, linked data such as DBpedia and Geonames and triple stores such as Sesame have been used to generate candidate answers and to score them under multiple points of view such as type coercion and geographic proximity. In addition, the connection between linked data and natural language text offered by Wikipedia has been very useful to generate open domain training data for relation detection and entity recognition systems, substantially improving the NLP capabilities of the system and therefore allowing the development of a truly open domain QA system.

In this tutorial we will look into fundamental design issues of semantic-content authoring technology and of the applications deploying such technology in order to find out which incentives speak to people to become engaged with the Semantic Web, and to determine the ways these incentives can be transferred into technology design. We will present how methods and techniques from areas as diverse as participation management, usability engineering, mechanism design, social computing, and game mechanics can be jointly applied to analyze semantically enabled applications, and subsequently design incentives-compatible variants thereof. The discussion will be framed by three case studies on the topics of enterprise knowledge management, media and entertainment, and IT ecosystems, in which combinations of these methods and techniques has led to increased user participation in creating useful semantic descriptions of various types of digital resources text documents, images, videos and Web services and APIs. Furthermore, we will revisit the best practices and guidelines that have been at the core of an earlier version of this tutorial at the previous edition of the ISWC in 2010, following the empirical findings and insights gained during the operation of the three case studies just mentioned. These guidelines provide IT developers with a baseline to create technology and end-user applications that are not just functional, but facilitate and encourage user participation that supports the further development of the Semantic Web.
