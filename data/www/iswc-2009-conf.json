Proceedings", "abstract": "A key question to the future of the semantic web is \u201chow will we acquire structured information to populate the semantic web on a vast scale?\u201d One approach is to enter this information manually. A second approach is to take advantage of the great deal of structured information already present in various databases, and to develop common ontologies, publishing standards, and reward systems to make this data widely accessible. We consider here a third approach: developing software that automatically extracts structured information from unstructured text present on the web. This talk will survey attempts to extract structured knowledge from unstructured text, and will focus on an approach with three characteristics that we hypothesize make it viable. First, in contrast to the very difficult problem of reading information from a single document, we consider the much easier problem of reading hundreds of millions of documents simultaneously, so that our system can extract facts that are stated manytimes by combining evidence from many documents. Second, our system begins with a given ontology that defines the types of information to be extracted, enabling it to focus its effort and to ignore most of the text that is irrelevant to the target ontology. Third, the system uses a new class of semi-supervised learning algorithms to learn how to extract information from web pages -- algorithms designed to achieve greater accuracy when given more complex ontologies. Our experiments show that this approach can produce knowledge bases containing tens of thousands of facts to populate given ontologies with approximately 90% accuracy, starting with only a handful of labeled training examples and 200 million unlabeled web pages.", "author": "Tom M.

Proceedings", "abstract": "Ontology matching is one of the key research topics in the field of the Semantic Web. There are many matching systems that generate mappings between different ontologies either automatically or semi-automatically. However, the mappings generated by these systems may be inconsistent with the ontologies. Several approaches have been proposed to deal with the inconsistencies between mappings and ontologies. This problem is often called a mapping revision problem, as the ontologies are assumed to be correct, whereas the mappings are repaired when resolving the inconsistencies. In this paper, we first propose a conflict-based mapping revision operator and show that it can be characterized by two logical postulates adapted from some existing postulates for belief base revision. We then provide an algorithm for iterative mapping revision by using an ontology revision operator and show that this algorithm defines a conflict-based mapping revision operator. Three concrete ontology revision operators are given to instantiate the iterative algorithm, which result in three different mapping revision algorithms. We implement these algorithms and provide some preliminary but interesting evaluation results.", "author": "Guilin Qi,Qiu Ji and Peter Haase", "topics": "", "proceedings_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2009/proceedings", "cnt_topic": "0", "cnt_url": "2", "list_url": "http://data.semanticweb.org/pdfs/iswc/2009/paper311.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-04930-9_33", "year": "2009", "keywords": "", "list_author": "Qiu Ji;Peter Haase;Guilin Qi", "cnt_author": "3", "paper_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2009/proceedings/paper-31", "pages": "521-536", "cnt_keyword": "0", "label_proceedings": "The Semantic Web - ISWC 2009"}, {"category": "Research Track Paper", "link_publisher": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-04930-9_10", "link_open_access": "http://data.semanticweb.org/pdfs/iswc/2009/paper253.pdf", "title": "A Decomposition-based Approach to Optimizing Conjunctive Query Answering in OWL DL", "subtitle_proceedings": "8th International Semantic Web Conference, ISWC 2009, Chantilly, VA, USA, October 25-29, 2009.

Towards tackling the scalability problem, we propose a decomposition-based approach to optimizing existing OWL DL reasoners in evaluating conjunctive queries in OWL DL ontologies. The main idea is to decompose a given OWL DL ontology into a set of target ontologies without duplicated ABox axioms so that the evaluation of a given conjunctive query can be separately performed in every target ontology by applying existing OWL DL reasoners. This approach guarantees sound and complete results for the category of conjunctive queries that the applied OWL DL reasoner correctly evaluates. Experimental results on large benchmark ontologies and benchmark queries show that the proposed approach can significantly improve scalability and efficiency in evaluating general conjunctive queries.", "author": "Jianfeng Du,Guilin Qi,Jeff Z.

Proceedings", "abstract": "The framework developed in this paper can deal with scenarios where selected sub-ontologies of a large ontology are offered as views to users, based on criteria like the user's access right, the trust level required by the application, or the level of detail requested by the user. Instead of materializing a large number of different sub-ontologies, we propose to keep just one ontology, but equip each axiom with a label from an appropriate labeling lattice. The access right, required trust level, etc. is then also represented by a label (called user label) from this lattice, and the corresponding sub-ontology is determined by comparing this label with the axiom labels. For large-scale ontologies, certain consequence (like the concept hierarchy) are often precomputed. Instead of precomputing these consequences for every possible sub-ontology, our approach computes just one label for each consequence such that a comparison of the user label with the consequence label determines whether the consequence follows from the corresponding sub-ontology or not. In this paper we determine under which restrictions on the user and axiom labels such consequence labels (called boundaries) always exist, describe different black-box approaches for computing boundaries, and present first experimental results that compare the efficiency of these approaches on large real-world ontologies. Black-box means that, rather than requiring modifications of existing reasoning procedures, these approaches can use such procedures directly as sub-procedures, which allows us to employ existing highly-optimized reasoners.", "author": "Franz Baader,Martin Knechtel and Rafael Pe\u00f1aloza", "topics": "", "proceedings_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2009/proceedings", "cnt_topic": "0", "cnt_url": "2", "list_url": "http://data.semanticweb.org/pdfs/iswc/2009/paper286.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-04930-9_4", "year": "2009", "keywords": "", "list_author": "Martin Knechtel;Rafael Pe\u00f1aloza;Franz Baader", "cnt_author": "3", "paper_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2009/proceedings/paper-29", "pages": "49-64", "cnt_keyword": "0", "label_proceedings": "The Semantic Web - ISWC 2009"}, {"category": "Research Track Paper", "link_publisher": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-04930-9_26", "link_open_access": "http://data.semanticweb.org/pdfs/iswc/2009/paper240.pdf", "title": "A Practical Approach for Scalable Conjunctive Query Answering on Acyclic EL+ Knowledge Base", "subtitle_proceedings": "8th International Semantic Web Conference, ISWC 2009, Chantilly, VA, USA, October 25-29, 2009.

The dynamic nature of mobile environment means that users need accurate and fast approaches for service discovery. In order achieve high accuracy semantic languages can be used in conjunction with logic reasoners. Since powerful broker nodes are not always available (due to lack of long range connectivity), create a bottleneck (since mobile devices are all trying to access the same server) and single point of failure (in the case that a central server fails), on-board mobile reasoning must be supported. However, reasoners are notoriously resource intensive and do not scale to small devices. Therefore, in this paper we provide an efficient mobile reasoner which relaxes the current strict and complete matching approaches to support anytime reasoning.

However, in many real-world applications, finding the alignment in a completely automatic way is highly infeasible. Ideally, an ontology matching system would have an interactive interface to allow users to provide feedbacks to guide the automatic algorithm. Fundamentally, we need answer the following questions: how can a system perform an efficiently interactive process with the user? How many interactions are sufficient for finding a more accurate matching? To address these questions, we propose an active learning framework for ontology matching, which tries to find the most informative candidate matches to query the user. The user\u0092s feedbacks are used to: 1) correct the mistake matching and 2) propagate the supervise information to help the entire matching process. Three measures are proposed to estimate the confidence of each matching candidate. A correct propagation algorithm is further proposed to maximize the spread of the user\u0092s \u0093guidance\u0094.

Attempts have previously been made to address the problem of forgetting in relatively simple description logics (DLs) such as DL-Lite and extended EL. The ontologies used in these attempts were mostly restricted to TBoxes rather than general knowledge bases (KBs). However, the issue of forgetting for general KBs in more expressive description logics, such as ALC and OWL DL, is largely unexplored. In particular, the problem of characterizing and computing forgetting for such logics is still open. In this paper, we first define semantic forgetting about concepts and roles in ALC ontologies and state several important properties of forgetting in this setting. We then define the result of forgetting for concept descriptions in ALC, state the properties of forgetting for concept descriptions, and present algorithms for computing the result of forgetting for concept descriptions. Unlike the case of DL-Lite, the result of forgetting for an ALC ontology does not exist in general, even for the special case of concept forgetting. This makes the problem of how to compute forgetting in ALC more challenging. We address this problem by defining a series of approximations to the result of forgetting for ALC ontologies and studying their properties and their application to reasoning tasks. We use the algorithms for computing forgetting for concept descriptions to compute these approximations. Our algorithms for computing approximations can be embedded into an ontology editor to enhance its ability to manage and reason in (large) ontologies.", "author": "Kewen Wang,Zhe Wang,Rodney W.

As RDF databases increase in size to approach tens of millions of triples, and as sophisticated graph matching queries expressible in languages like SPARQL become increasingly important, scalability becomes an issue. To date, there is no graph-based indexing method for RDF data where the index was designed in a way that makes it disk-resident. There is therefore a growing need for indexes that can operate efficiently when the index itself resides on disk. In this paper, we first propose the DOGMA index for fast subgraph matching on disk and then develop a basic algorithm to answer queries over this index. This algorithm is then significantly sped up via an optimized algorithm that uses efficient (but correct) pruning strategies when combined with two different extensions of the index. We have implemented a preliminary system and tested it against four existing RDF database systems developed by others. Our experiments show that our algorithm performs very well compared to these systems, with orders of magnitude improvements for complex graph queries.", "author": "Matthias Br\u00f6cheler,Andrea Pugliese and V.

In this paper, we show that SPARQL faces certain unwanted ramifications when querying ontologies in conjunction with RDF datasets that comprise multiple named graphs, and we provide an extension for SPARQL that remedies these effects. Moreover, since RDFS inference has a close relationship with logic rules, we generalize our approach to select a custom ruleset for specifying inferences to be taken into account in a SPARQL query. We show that our extensions are technically feasible by providing benchmark results for RDFS querying in our prototype system GiaBATA, which uses Datalog coupled with a persistent Relational Database as a back-end for implementing SPARQL with dynamic rule-based inference.

In this paper we present an approach to execute SPARQL queries over the Web of Linked Data.

The URIs are resolved over the HTTP protocol into RDF data which is continuously added to the queried dataset.

Alternatively, query languages like SPARQL provide means to express information needs in structured form; hence they are targeted towards developers and experts. Inspired by the concept of spreadsheet tools, where users can perform relatively complex calculations by splitting formulas and values across multiple cells, we have investigated mechanisms that allow us to access RDF graphs in a more intuitive and manageable, yet formally grounded manner. In this paper, we make three contributions towards this direction.

Second, we define a syntax for expressing RDFunctions, which can be edited, parsed and evaluated. Third, we discuss Tripcel, an implementation of RDFunctions using a spreadsheet metaphor.

However, the existing module extraction methods that compute a syntactic locality-based module for the sub-concept in a subsumption entailment, though ensuring the resulting module to preserve all justifications of the entailment, may be insufficient in improving the performance of finding all justifications. This is because a syntactic locality-based module is independent of the super-concept in a subsumption entailment and always contains all concept/role assertions. In order to extract smaller modules to further optimize finding all justifications in an OWL DL ontology, we propose a goal-directed method for extracting a module that preserves all justifications of a given entailment.

However, since relationship extraction methods are imprecise and cannot homogeneously cover all concepts, the initial set of relationships is usually inconsistent and rather imbalanced - a problem which, to the best of our knowledge, was mostly ignored so far. In this paper, we define the problem of extracting a consistent as well as properly structured ontology from a set of inconsistent and heterogeneous relationships. Moreover, we propose and compare three graph-based methods for solving the ontology extraction problem.

Proceedings", "abstract": "An important issue for the Semantic Web is how to combine open-world ontology languages with closed-world (non-monotonic) rule paradigms. Several proposals for hybrid languages allow concepts to be simultaneously defined by an ontology and rules, where rules may refer to concepts in the ontology and the ontology may also refer to predicates defined by the rules. Hybrid MKNF knowledge bases are one such proposal, for which both a stable and a well-founded semantics have been defined. The definition of Hybrid MKNF knowledge bases is parametric on the ontology language, in the sense that non-monotonic rules can extend any decidable ontology language. In this paper we define a query-driven procedure for Hybrid MKNF knowledge bases that is sound with respect to the original stable model-based semantics, and is correct with respect to the well-founded semantics. This procedure is able to answer conjunctive queries, and is parametric on an inference engine for reasoning in the ontology language. Our procedure is based on an extension of a tabled rule evaluation to capture reasoning within an ontology by modeling it as an interaction with an external oracle and, with some assumptions on the complexity of the oracle compared to the complexity of the ontology language, maintains the data complexity of the well-founded semantics for hybrid MKNF knowledge bases.", "author": "Jos\u00e9 J\u00falio Alferes,Matthias Knorr and Terrance Swift", "topics": "", "proceedings_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2009/proceedings", "cnt_topic": "0", "cnt_url": "2", "list_url": "http://data.semanticweb.org/pdfs/iswc/2009/paper424.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-04930-9_1", "year": "2009", "keywords": "", "list_author": "Matthias Knorr;Terrance Swift;Jos\u00e9 J\u00falio Alferes", "cnt_author": "3", "paper_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2009/proceedings/paper-03", "pages": "1-16", "cnt_keyword": "0", "label_proceedings": "The Semantic Web - ISWC 2009"}, {"category": "Research Track Paper", "link_publisher": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-04930-9_40", "link_open_access": "http://data.semanticweb.org/pdfs/iswc/2009/paper374.pdf", "title": "Scalable Distributed Reasoning using MapReduce", "subtitle_proceedings": "8th International Semantic Web Conference, ISWC 2009, Chantilly, VA, USA, October 25-29, 2009.

Large amounts and high diversity of knowledge in the Semantic Web pose the challenging question of appropriate relevance ranking for producing fine-grained and rich descriptions of the available data, e.g. to guide the user along most promising knowledge aspects. Existing methods for graph-based authority ranking lack support for fine-grained latent coherence between resources and predicates (i.e. support for link semantics in the linked data model). In this paper, we present TripleRank, a novel approach for faceted authority ranking in the context of RDF knowledge bases. TripleRank captures the additional latent semantics of Semantic Web data by means of statistical methods in order to produce richer descriptions of the available data. We model the Semantic Web by a 3-dimensional tensor that enables the seamless representation of arbitrary semantic links. For the analysis of that model, we apply the PARAFAC decomposition, which can be seen as a multi-modal counterpart to Web authority ranking with HITS. The result are groupings of resources and predicates that characterize their authority and navigational (hub) properties with respect to identified topics.

In such environments, the authority of data sources is an important signal that the ranking algorithm has to take into account. This paper presents algorithms for prioritising data returned by queries over web datasets expressed in RDF. We introduce the notion of naming authority which provides a correspondence between identifiers and the sources which can speak authoritatively for these identifiers. Our algorithm uses the original PageRank method to assign authority values to data sources based on a naming authority graph, and then propagates the authority values to identifiers referenced in the sources.

We then analyzed the mappings and what they tell us about the ontologies themselves, the structure of the ontology repository, and the ways in which the mappings can help in the process of ontology design and evaluation. For example, we can use the mappings to guide users who are new to a field to the most pertinent ontologies in that field, to identify areas of the domain that are not covered sufficiently by the ontologies in the repository, and to identify which ontologies will serve well as background knowledge in domain-specific tools.

The set of available expression functions includes most of the native functions of OpenOffice Calc and can be easily extended by users of XLWrap.

People are spending more and more time viewing online videos as a major source of entertainment and \u0093infotainment\u0094. Social websites allow users to assign shared free-form tags to user-generated multimedia resources, thus generating annotations for objects with a minimum amount of effort. Tagging allows communities to organize their multimedia items into browseable sets, but these tags may be poorly chosen and related tags may be omitted. Current techniques to retrieve, integrate and present this media to users are deficient and could do with improvement. In this paper we describe a framework for semantic enrichment, ranking and integration of web video tags using Semantic Web technologies. Semantic enrichment of folksonomies can bridge the gap between the uncontrolled and flat structures typically found in user-generated content and structures provided by the Semantic Web. The enhancement of tag spaces with semantics has been accomplished through two major tasks: (1) a tag space expansion and ranking step; and (2) through concept matching and integration with the Linked Data cloud. We have explored social, temporal and spatial contexts to enrich and extend the existing tag space. The resulting semantic tag space is modelled via a local graph based on co-occurrence distances for ranking.

In this paper we tackle one of the most popular CMS: Drupal. We enable site administrators to export their site content model and data to the Web of Data without requiring extensive knowledge on Semantic Web technologies. Our modules create RDFa annotations and -- optionally -- a SPARQL endpoint for any Drupal site out of the box. Likewise, we add the means to map the site data to existing ontologies on the Web with a search interface to find commonly used ontology terms. We also allow a Drupal site administrator to include existing RDF data from remote SPARQL endpoints on the Web in the site.

However, currently available implementations are designed for simple data processing on structured data. In this paper, we present a language, RAPID, for scalable ad-hoc analytical processing of RDF data on Map-Reduce frameworks. It builds on Yahoo\u0092s Pig Latin by introducing primitives based on a specialized join operator, the MD-join, for expressing analytical tasks in a manner that is more amenable to parallel processing, as well as primitives for coping with semi-structured nature of RDF data.

We describe our approach to facilitating such events: describe the systems and requirements in great detail using ontologies, and use automated reasoning to automatically find and help resolve problems. The complexity of our problem took us to the limits of what one can do with OWL, and we needed to introduce some innovative techniques of using and extending it. We describe our novel ways of using SWRL and discuss its limitations as well as extensions to it that we found necessary or desirable. Another innovation is our representation of hierarchical tasks in OWL, and an engine that reasons about them.

To make the effective use of the CDM system, this paper investigates semantic query and analysis over the integrated and centralized customer data, enabling automatic classification and relationship discovery.

Our purpose is to streamline one library's book description process by suggesting new subjects based on descriptions created by other institutions, even when the vocabularies used are different. The case at hand concerns the National Library of the Netherlands (KB) and the network of Dutch local public libraries. We present a prototype subject suggestion tool, which is directly connected to the KB production cataloguing environment. We also report on the results of a user study and evaluation to assess the feasibility of exploiting state-of-the art techniques in such a real-life application. Our prototype demonstrates that SW components can be seamlessly plugged into the KB production environment, which potentially brings a higher level of flexibility and openness to networked Cultural Heritage (CH) institutions. Technical hurdles can be tackled and the suggested subjects are often relevant, opening up exciting new perspectives on the daily work of the KB.

Drawing upon Wikipedia's model of massive user collaboration, WikiEarth's motivation is to extend beyond this by formalizing the relationships between the data being entered. A semantic ontology is a natural candidate for data representation for three reasons: first, the hierarchical class structure of an OWL-Ontology helps avoid redundancy when developing simulations, as an operation can be applied to a class and all its subclasses; secondly, a framework like Jena helps eliminate human error and reduce the amount of data entry that needs to be performed; and finally, important restrictions regarding data entry are imposed by the ontological structure and Jena, as opposed to by a proprietary system developed for one specific application. Utilizing this infrastructure, a WikiEarth Climate Demonstration was successfully conceptualized, constructed, deployed and subsequently unveiled at the 2009 World Student Environmental Summit.

Since web services can be enhanced with formal semantic descriptions, forming the \"semantic web services\", it becomes conceivable to exploit the quality of semantic links between services (of any composition) as one of the optimization criteria. For this we propose to use the semantic similarities between output and input parameters of web services. Coupling this with other criteria such as quality of service (QoS) allow us to rank and optimize compositions achieving the same goal. We present the Composition Optimizer tool, using an innovative and extensible optimization model designed to balance semantic fit (or functional quality) with non-functional QoS metrics, in order to optimize service composition.

The reader thus obtains an overview of the content, without having to read through the text. In building a compact semantic graph, an important step is grouping similar concepts under the same label and connecting them to external repositories. This is achieved through disambiguating word senses, in our case by assigning the sense to a concept given its context.

The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the U.S. Global Change Research Program, and individual U.S. agencies have produced important studies of climate change. However, the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) alone is over 2600 pages. Within these pages, LMI identified 2693 findings that include specific defined levels of uncertainty. The findings from the IPCC have been so thoroughly demonstrated by the scientific method that it would be a failure of responsibility to ignore them.

They often provide a large amount of category definitions and some sort of hierarchies. Thanks to their size and popularity, they are a promising ground for publishing and organizing data on the Semantic Web. Unfortunately, classifications can mostly not be directly used as ontologies in OWL, because they are not (or at least: very bad) ontologies. In particular, the labels in categories often lack a context-neutral notion of what it means to be an instance of that category, and the meaning of the hierarchical relations is often not a strict subClassOf. SKOS2OWL is an online tool that allows deriving consistent RDF-S or OWL ontologies from most hierarchical classifications available in the W3C SKOS exchange format.

SPoX (Skype Policy Extension) enables users to define policies stating, for example, who is allowed to call and whose chat messages show up. Moreover, SPoX reacts to arbitrary events in Skype's Social Network as well, such as on-line status changes of users or the birthday of a friend. The decisions about how SPoX reacts are defined by means of Semantic Web policies that do not only consider the context of the user (such as time or on-line status) but include Social Semantic Web data into the policy reasoning process. By this means, users can state that, for instance, only people defined as friends in their FOAF profile, only friends on Twitter, or even only people they wrote a paper with are allowed to call. Further, SPoX exploits Semantic Web techniques for advanced negotiations by means of exchanging policies over the Skype application channel. This procedure allows two clients to negotiate trust based on their SPoX policies before a connection - for example a Skype call - is established.", "author": "Philipp Karger,Emily Kigel and VenkatRam Yadav Jaltar", "topics": "", "proceedings_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2009/poster-demo-proceedings", "cnt_topic": "0", "cnt_url": "1", "list_url": "https://github.com/lidingpku/iswc-archive/raw/master/paper/iswc-2009-poster/136/paper136.pdf", "year": "2009", "keywords": "", "list_author": "VenkatRam Yadav Jaltar;Philipp Karger;Emily Kigel", "cnt_author": "3", "paper_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2009/poster-demo-proceedings/paper-45", "pages": "", "cnt_keyword": "0", "label_proceedings": "Proceedings of ISWC 2009 Poster and Demo"}, {"category": "Poster/Demo Paper", "link_publisher": "", "link_open_access": "https://github.com/lidingpku/iswc-archive/raw/master/paper/iswc-2009-poster/129/paper129.pdf", "title": "STARS \uff96 Semantic Tools for Screen Arts Research", "subtitle_proceedings": "", "abstract": "STARS is an open source e-research tool that enables screen arts researchers to browse, annotate and replay moving image content in order to better understand its thematic links to those people and communities involved in all aspects of its creation.

Many approaches and specifications are available that work towards realization of this vision: Service-oriented architectures (SOA) provide a good level of abstraction for interoperability; Web Services provide programmatic interfaces for application to application communication in SOA; there are ontologies that can be used for machine-readable description of service semantics. What is still missing is a standard for constructing semantically formulated service requests that solely rely on shared domain ontologies without depending on programatic or even semantically described interfaces. emph{Semantic RPC} would then include the whole process from issuing such a request, matchmaking with semantic profiles of available and accessible services, deriving input parameters for the matched service(s), calling the service(s), getting the results, and mapping back the results onto an appropriate response to the original request. The standard must avoid realization-specific assumptions so that frameworks supporting semantic RPC can be built for bridging the gap between the semantically formulated service requests and matched programmatic interfaces.

While in many cases, just presenting the justification is sufficient for user understanding, and in all cases justifications are much better than nothing, we have empirically identified cases where understanding how a justification supports an entailment is inordinately difficult. Indeed there are naturally occurring justifications that people, with varying expertise in OWL, cannot understand. To address this problem, we have developed a novel conceptual framework for justification oriented proofs. Given a justification for an entailment in an ontology, intermediate inference steps, called lemmas, are automatically derived, that bridge the gap between the axioms in the justification and the entailment. The proof shows in a stepwise way how the lemmas and ultimately the entailment follow from the justification. At the heart of the framework is the notion of a ``complexity model'', which predicts how easy or difficult it is for a user to understand a justification, and is used for selecting the lemmas to insert into a proof. This poster and demo presents this framework backed by a prototype implementation.", "author": "Matthew Horridge,Bijan Parsia and Ulrike Sattler", "topics": "", "proceedings_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2009/poster-demo-proceedings", "cnt_topic": "0", "cnt_url": "1", "list_url": "https://github.com/lidingpku/iswc-archive/raw/master/paper/iswc-2009-poster/138/paper138.pdf", "year": "2009", "keywords": "", "list_author": "Matthew Horridge;Ulrike Sattler;Bijan Parsia", "cnt_author": "3", "paper_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2009/poster-demo-proceedings/paper-54", "pages": "", "cnt_keyword": "0", "label_proceedings": "Proceedings of ISWC 2009 Poster and Demo"}, {"category": "Poster/Demo Paper", "link_publisher": "", "link_open_access": "https://github.com/lidingpku/iswc-archive/raw/master/paper/iswc-2009-poster/190/paper190.pdf", "title": "Viewpoint Management for Multi-Perspective issues of Ontologies", "subtitle_proceedings": "", "abstract": "This paper discusses semantic technologies for multi-perspective issues of ontologies based on ontological viewpoint management.

In CDAs, medical ontologies/terminologies, e.g. SNOMED CT[2], are used to specify the semantic meaning of clinical statements. To better use the structure and semantic information in CDAs for a more effective search, we propose and implement the iSMART system. Firstly, we design and implement an XML-to-RDF convertor to extract RDF statements from medical records using declarative mapping. Then, we design a reasoner to infer additional information by integrating the knowledge from the domain ontologies based on the extracted RDF statements. Finally, we index the inferred set of RDF statements and provide the semantic search on them.

Events, simple or complex, are models for things that happen e.g., when a user interacts with a Web page. Events are consumed in some meaningful way e.g., for monitoring reasons or to trigger actions such as responses. In order for receiving parties to understand events e.g., comprehend what has led to an event, we propose a general event schema using RDFS. In this schema we cover the composition of complex events and event-to-event relationships. These events can then be used to route semantic information about an occurrence to different recipients helping in making the Semantic Web active. Additionally, we present an architecture for detecting and composing events in Web clients. For the contents of events we show a way of how they are enriched with semantic information about the context in which they occurred.
