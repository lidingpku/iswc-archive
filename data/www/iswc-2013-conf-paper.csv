Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a formal transformation of  $\mathcal{ELI}$ (an extension of $\mathcal{EL}$ with \textit{inverse roles}) ontologies into an FCA framework, i.e.  $K_\mathrm{\mathcal{ELI}}$, and we provide a formal characterization of this transformation. Then we show that SPARQL query answering over  $\mathcal{ELI}$ ontologies can be reduced to lattice query answering over  $K_\mathrm{\mathcal{ELI}}$ concept lattices.

At over 31 billion triples in 2011, querying this globally distributed data space poses several scalability challenges. One critical aspect when processing distributed SPARQL queries is given by the number and type of distributed joins needed. Traditionally, query optimizers alleviate this issue by attempting to find an optimal query plan assuming a given and fixed data distribution. Discarding this fixed data partitioning assumption, offers the opportunity to create a data distribution that minimizes the number of distributed joins. Recent research focused on data- and query-driven partitioning strategies for both RDF and relational data. In this paper we propose a novel and naive workload-driven approach to data partitioning and investigate the impact of various critical factors on the number of resulting distributed joins. In a preliminary experiment we empirically compare our method to traditional partitioning strategies using a DBpedia query log of 400’000 queries and observe that it can produce up to 50% less distributed joins than an expert (manual) partitioning scheme, 45% less than partitioning based on hashing by subject and up to 83% less distributed joins than just random assignment.",Poster/Demo Paper,,0,,0,Cosmin Basca;Abraham Bernstein,2,,0

Then in the contextual tag cloud, the font size of each tag depends on the number of instances that are associated with that tag and all tags in the context. Each contextual tag cloud serves as a summary of the distribution of relevant data, and by changing the context, the user can quickly gain an understanding of patterns in the data. Furthermore, the user can choose to include RDFS taxonomic and/or domain/range entailment in the calculations of tag sizes, thereby understanding the impact of semantics on the data.

A uniform scheduling strategy---a uniform distribution of computation load among available machines---typically used by stream processing systems, disregards network-load as one of the major bottlenecks for throughput resulting in an immense load in terms of inter-machine communication. We propose a graph-partitioning based approach for workload scheduling within stream processing systems.We implemented a distributed triple-stream processing engine on top of the Storm realtime computation framework and evaluate its communication behavior using two real-world datasets. We show that the application of graph partitioning algorithms can decrease inter-machine communication substantially (by 40% to 99%) whilst maintaining an even workload distribution, even using very limited data statistics.

For users, the key question is how often they will encounter those pathological inputs in practice, that is, how robust are reasoners. We attempt to determine this question for classification of existing ontologies as they are found on the Web. It is a fairly common user task to examine ontologies published on the Web as part of their development process. Thus, the robustness of reasoners in this scenario is both directly interesting and provides some hints toward answering the broader question.

The focus of our study is on improving diabetes patient selection for clinical trials or medical research. The biggest impediment to automating such clinical tasks is the essential requirement of bridging the semantic gaps between existing patient data from electronic health records, such as reasons for visit, chronic conditions and diagnoses from practice notes, pathology tests and prescriptions stored in general practice information systems, and the ways which researchers or general practitioners interpret those records. Our current comprehension is that automation of identifying diabetes patients for clinical or research purposes can be specified systematically as a solution supported by semantic retrieval. We detail the challenges to build a realistic case study, which consists of solving issues related to conceptualization of data and domain context, integration of different datasets, ontology creation based on SNOMED CT-AU® standard, mapping between existing data and ontology, and dilemma of data fitness for research use.

Most of the related work focuses on automatic annotation with classes or properties of source attributes or input and output parameters. However, constructing a source model that includes the relationships between the attributes in addition to their semantic types remains a largely unsolved problem. In this paper, we present a graph-based approach to hypothesize a rich semantic description of a new target source from a set of known sources that have been modeled over the same domain ontology. We exploit the domain ontology and the known source models to build a graph that represents the space of plausible source descriptions. Then, we compute the top k candidates and suggest to the user a ranked list of the semantic models for the new source. The approach takes into account user corrections to learn more accurate semantic descriptions of future data sources.

This work presents DAW, a novel duplicate-aware approach to federated querying over the Web of Data. DAW is based on a combination of min-wise independent permutations and compact data summaries.

We extend three well-known federated query processing engines – DARQ, SPLENDID, and FedX – with DAW and compare our extensions with the original approaches. The comparison shows that DAW can greatly reduce the number of queries sent to the endpoints, while keeping high query recall values.

In this paper, we propose an approach for automatically discovering the missing entity links in Wikipedia’s infoboxes, so that the missing semantic relations between entities can be established.

In this context, materializing every possible implicit derivation from a given input can be computationally expensive, especially when considering large data volumes. Most of the solutions that address this problem rely on the assumption that the information is static, i.e., that it does not change, or changes very infrequently. However, the Web is extremely dynamic: online newspapers, blogs, social networks, etc., are frequently changed so that outdated information is removed and replaced with fresh data. This demands for a materialization that is not only scalable, but also reactive to changes. In this paper, we consider the problem of incremental materialization, that is, how to update the materialized derivations when new data is added or removed. To this purpose, we consider the ρdf RDFS fragment [12], and present a parallel system that implements a number of algorithms to quickly recalculate the derivation. In case new data is added, our system uses a parallel version of the well-known semi-naive evaluation of Datalog. In case of removals, we have implemented two algorithms, one based on previous theoretical work, and another one that is more efficient since it does not require a complete scan of the input. We have evaluated the performance using a prototype system called DynamiTE , which organizes the knowledge bases with a number of indices to facilitate the query process and exploits parallelism to improve the performance. The results show that our methods are indeed capable to recalculate the derivation in a short time, opening the door to reasoning on much more dynamic data than is currently possible.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Alessandro Margara;Ceriel Jacobs;Frank Van Harmelen;Jacopo Urbani;Henri Bal,5,"http://www.springer.com/computer/ai/book/978-3-642-41334-6,https://github.com/lidingpku/iswc-archive/raw/master/paper/iswc-2013/82180641-dynamite-parallel-materialization-of-dynamic-rdf-data.pdf",2

Here we consider three logically sound notions of modules: MEX modules, only applicable to inexpressive ontologies; modules based on semantic locality, a sound approximation of the ﬁrst; and modules based on syntactic locality, a sound approximation of the second (and thus the ﬁrst), widely used since these modules can be extracted from OWL DL ontologies in time polynomial in the size of the ontology. In this paper we investigate the quality of both approximations over a large corpus of ontologies, using our own implementation of semantic locality, which is the ﬁrst to our knowledge. In particular, we show with statistical signiﬁcance that, in most cases, there is no difference between the two module notions based on locality; where they differ, the additional axioms can either be easily ruled out or their number is relatively small. We classify the axioms that explain the rare differences into four kinds of “culprits” and discuss which of those can be avoided by extending the deﬁnition of syntactic locality. Finally, we show that differences between MEX and locality-based modules occur for a minority of ontologies from our corpus and largely affect (approximations of ) expressive ontologies – this conclusion relies on a much larger and more diverse sample than existing comparisons between MEX and syntactic locality-based modules.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Bijan Parsia;Pavel Klinov;Thomas Schneider;Dmitry Tsarkov;Chiara Del Vescovo;Ulrike Sattler,6,"http://www.springer.com/computer/ai/book/978-3-642-41334-6,https://github.com/lidingpku/iswc-archive/raw/master/paper/iswc-2013/82180081-empirical-study-of-logic-based-modules-cheap-is-cheerful.pdf",2

Further, these sources capture complementary but also redundant information about entities. In this environment of uncooperative data sources, we study the problem of federated entity search, where redundant information about entities is reduced on-the-ﬂy through entity consolidation performed at query time.

When a user searches a collection of ontologies for her terms of interest, there are often dozens of ontologies that contain these terms. How does she know which ontology is the most relevant to her search? Our research group hosts BioPortal, a public repository of more than 330 ontologies in the biomedical domain. When a term that a user searches for is available in multiple ontologies, how do we rank the results and how do we measure how well our ranking works? In this paper, we develop an evaluation framework that enables developers to compare and analyze the performance of different ontology-ranking methods. Our framework is based on processing search logs and determining how often users select the top link that the search engine offers. We evaluate our framework by analyzing the data on BioPortal searches. We explore several different ranking algorithms and measure the effectiveness of each ranking by measuring how often users click on the highest ranked ontology. We collected log data from more than 4,800 BioPortal searches. Our results show that regardless of the ranking, in more than half the searches, users select the ﬁrst link. Thus, it is even more critical to ensure that the ranking is appropriate if we want to have satisﬁed users. Our further analysis demonstrates that ranking ontologies based on page view data signiﬁcantly improves the user experience, with an approximately 26% increase in the number of users who select the highest ranked ontology for the search.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Rave Harpaz;Mark A.

While incremental classiﬁcation modulo additions is relatively straightforward, handling deletions is more problematic since it requires retracting logical consequences that are no longer valid. Known algorithms address this problem using various forms of bookkeeping to trace the consequences back to premises. But such additional data can consume memory and place an extra burden on the reasoner during application of inferences.

The contextual tag cloud system is a novel application that helps users explore a large scale RDF dataset: the tags are ontological terms (classes and properties), the context is a set of tags that deﬁnes a subset of instances, and the font sizes reﬂect the number of instances that use each tag. It visualizes the patterns of instances speciﬁed by the context a user constructs. Given a request with a speciﬁc context, the system needs to quickly ﬁnd what other tags the instances in the context use, and how many instances in the context use each tag. The key question we answer in this paper is how to scale to Linked Data; in particular we use a dataset with 1.4 billion triples and over 380,000 tags. This is complicated by the fact that the calculation should, when directed by the user, consider the entailment of taxonomic and/or domain/range axioms in the ontology. We combine a scalable preprocessing approach with a specially-constructed inverted index and use three approaches to prune unnecessary counts for faster intersection computations.

Addressing this task is especially challenging when dealing with geo-spatial datasets due to their sheer size and the potential complexity of single geo-spatial objects. Yet, so far, little attention has been paid to the characteristics of geo-spatial data within the context of link discovery. In this paper, we address this gap by presenting Orchid, a reduction-ratio-optimal link discovery approach designed especially for geo-spatial data. Orchid relies on a combination of the Hausdorff and orthodromic metrics to compute the distance between geo-spatial objects. We ﬁrst present two novel approaches for the efficient computation of Hausdorff distances. Then, we present the space tiling approach implemented by Orchid and prove that it is optimal with respect to the reduction ratio that it can achieve. The evaluation of our approaches is carried out on three real datasets of different size and complexity. Our results suggest that our approaches to the computation of Hausdorff distances require two orders of magnitude less orthodromic distances computations to compare geographical data. Moreover, they require two orders of magnitude less time than a naive approach to achieve this goal. Finally, our results indicate that Orchid scales to large datasets while outperforming the state of the art signiﬁcantly.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo,1,"http://www.springer.com/computer/ai/book/978-3-642-41334-6,https://github.com/lidingpku/iswc-archive/raw/master/paper/iswc-2013/82180385-orchid-reduction-ratio-optimal-computation-of-geo-spatial-distances-for-link-discovery.pdf",2

In this paper, we propose a general authorisation framework that can be used to deliver dynamic query results based on user credentials and to cater for the secure manipulation of linked data. Speciﬁcally we describe how graph patterns, propagation rules, conﬂict resolution policies and integrity constraints can together be used to specify and enforce consistent access control policies.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Sabrina Kirrane;Stefan Decker;Alessandra Mileo;Ahmed Abdelrahman,4,"http://www.springer.com/computer/ai/book/978-3-642-41334-6,https://github.com/lidingpku/iswc-archive/raw/master/paper/iswc-2013/82180241-secure-manipulation-of-linked-data.pdf",2

As a result a set of relation-speciﬁc relevant concepts is obtained, and each of these concepts is then used to represent the structured semantics of the corresponding relation.

As the group that developed Protégé, the most widely used ontology editor, we are keenly aware of how difficult the users perceive this task to be. In this paper, we present the new version of WebProtégé that we designed with two main goals in mind: (1) create a tool that will be easy to use while still accounting for commonly used OWL constructs; (2) support collaboration and social interaction around distributed ontology editing as part of the core tool design. We designed this new version of the WebProtégé user interface empirically, by analysing the use of OWL constructs in a large corpus of publicly available ontologies. Since the beta release of this new WebProtégé interface in January 2013, our users from around the world have created and uploaded 519 ontologies on our server. In this paper, we describe the key features of the new tool and our empirical design approach. We evaluate language coverage in WebProtégé by assessing how well it covers the OWL constructs that are present in ontologies that users have uploaded to WebProtégé. We evaluate the usability of WebProtégé through a usability survey.

A common problem is the imprecision in the use of vocabularies: annotators can misunderstand the semantics of a class or property or may not be able to ﬁnd the right objects to annotate with. This decreases the quality of data and may eventually hamper its usability over large scale. This paper describes Statistical Knowledge Patterns (SKP) as a means to address this issue. SKPs encapsulate key information about ontology classes, including synonymous properties in (and across) datasets, and are automatically generated based on statistical data analysis. SKPs can be effectively used to automatically normalise data, and hence increase recall in querying. Both pattern extraction and pattern usage are completely automated. The main beneﬁts of SKPs are that: (1) their structure allows for both accurate query expansion and restriction; (2) they are context dependent, hence they describe the usage and meaning of properties in the context of a particular class; and (3) they can be generated oﬄine, hence the equivalence among relations can be used efficiently at run time.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Ziqi Zhang;Fabio Ciravegna;Anna Lisa Gentile;Eva Blomqvist;Isabelle Augenstein,5,"http://www.springer.com/computer/ai/book/978-3-642-41334-6,https://github.com/lidingpku/iswc-archive/raw/master/paper/iswc-2013/82180687-statistical-knowledge-patterns-identifying-synonymous-relations-in-large-linked-datasets.pdf",2

For this reason, Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs) increasingly contain information about the searched entities such as pictures, short summaries, related entities, and factual information. A key facet that is often displayed on the SERPs and that is instrumental for many applications is the entity type. However, an entity is usually not associated to a single generic type in the background knowledge bases but rather to a set of more speciﬁc types, which may be relevant or not given the document context. For example, one can ﬁnd on the Linked Open Data cloud the fact that Tom Hanks is a person, an actor, and a person from Concord, California. All those types are correct but some may be too general to be interesting (e.g., person), while other may be interesting but already known to the user (e.g., actor), or may be irrelevant given the current browsing context (e.g., person from Concord, California). In this paper, we deﬁne the new task of ranking entity types given an entity and its context. We propose and evaluate new methods to ﬁnd the most relevant entity type based on collection statistics and on the graph structure interconnecting entities and types. An extensive experimental evaluation over several document collections at different levels of granularity (e.g., sentences, paragraphs, etc.) and different type hierarchies (including DBPedia, Freebase, and schema.org) shows that hierarchy-based approaches provide more accurate results when picking entity types to be displayed to the end-user while still being highly scalable.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Gianluca Demartini;Karl Aberer;Michele Catasta;Alberto Tonon;Philippe Cudré-Mauroux,5,"https://github.com/lidingpku/iswc-archive/raw/master/paper/iswc-2013/82180625-trank-ranking-entity-types-using-the-web-of-data.pdf,http://www.springer.com/computer/ai/book/978-3-642-41334-6",2

It is frequently unclear, however, to what degree extralogical ontology errors negatively affect the application that the ontology underpins. For example, “Shoe SubClassOf Foot” may be correct logically, but not in a human interpretation. Indeed, such errors, not caught by reasoning, are likely to be domain-speciﬁc, and thus identifying salient ontology errors requires consideration of the domain. There are both automated and manual methods that provide ontology quality assurance. Nevertheless, these methods do not readily scale as ontology size increases, and do not necessarily identify the most salient extralogical errors. Recently, crowdsourcing has enabled solutions to complex problems that computers alone cannot solve. For instance, human workers can quickly and more accurately identify objects in images at scale. Crowdsourcing presents an opportunity to develop methods for ontology quality assurance that overcome the current limitations of scalability and applicability. In this work, I aim (1) to determine the effect of extralogical ontology errors in an example domain, (2) to develop a scalable framework for crowdsourcing ontology veriﬁcation that overcomes current ontology Q/A method limitations, and (3) to apply this framework to ontologies in use. I will then evaluate the method itself and also its effect in the context of a speciﬁc domain. As an example domain, I will use biomedicine, which applies many large-scale ontologies.

Spark extracts several signals from a variety of data sources, including Yahoo! Web Search, Twitter, and Flickr, using a large cluster of computers running Hadoop.

This problem is very important for query optimization purposes. In the SPARQL context, it can be equally useful. This problem has recently been investigated theoretically and some query containment solvers are available. Yet, there were no benchmarks to compare theses systems and foster their improvement. In order to experimentally assess implementation strengths and limitations, we provide a rst SPARQL containment test benchmark. It has been designed with respect to both the capabilities of existing solvers and the study of typical queries. Some solvers support optional constructs and cycles, while other solvers support pro jection, union of conjunctive queries and RDF Schemas. No solver currently supports all these features or OWL entailment regimes. The study of query demographics on DBPedia logs shows that the vast ma jority of queries are acyclic and a signicant part of them uses UNION or pro jection. We thus test available solvers on their domain of applicability on three dierent benchmark suites.

Semantic web technologies should be ideal for exploring the complex networks of genes, proteins and metabolites that interact, but much of this data is not natively available to the semantic web. Data is typically collected and stored with free-text annotations in spreadsheets, many of which do not conform to existing metadata standards and are often not publica lly released. Along with initiatives to promote more data sharing, one of the main challenges is therefore to semantically annotate and extract this data so that it is available to the research community. Data annotation and curation are expensive and undervalued tasks that have enormous benefits to the discipline as a whole, but fewer benefits to the individual data producers. By embedding semantic annotation into spreadsheets, however, and automat ically extracting this data into RDF at the time of repository submission, the process of producing standards-compliant data, that is available for semantic web querying, can be achieved without adding additional overheads to laboratory data management. This paper describes these strategies in the context of semantic data management in the SEEK. The SEEK is a web-based resource for sharing and exchanging Systems Biology data and models that is underpinned by the JERM ontology (Just Enough Results Model), which describes the relationships between data, models, protocols and experiments.

Different query rewriting systems give support to different ontology languages with varying expressiveness, and the rewritten queries obtained as an output do also vary in expressiveness. This heterogeneity has traditionally made it difficult to compare different approaches, and the area lacks in general commonly agreed benchmarks that could be used not only for such comparisons but also for improving OBDA support.

However the BBC’s archive catalogue is not a complete record of everything that was ever broadcast. For example, it excludes the BBC World Service, which has been broadcasting since 1932. This makes the discovery of content within these parts of the archive very difficult. In this paper we describe a system based on Semantic Web technologies which helps us to quickly locate content related to current news events within those parts of the BBC’s archive with little or no pre-existing metadata. This system is driven by automated interlinking of archive content with the Semantic Web, user validations of the resulting data and topic extraction from live BBC News subtitles. The resulting inter-links between live news subtitles and the BBC’s archive are used in a dynamic visualisation enabling users to quickly locate relevant content. This content can then be used by journalists and editors to provide historical context, background information and supporting content around current affairs.",Semantic Web In Use Track Paper,,0,,0,Andrew McParland;Michael Smethurst;Yves Raimond;Christopher Lowis,4,"http://www.springer.com/computer/ai/book/978-3-642-41337-7,https://github.com/lidingpku/iswc-archive/raw/master/paper/iswc-2013/82190145-using-the-past-to-explain-the-present-interlinking-current-affairs-with-archives-via-the-semantic-web.pdf",2

We are witnessing a growing number of efforts that treat workﬂows as ﬁrst-class artifacts for sharing and exchanging scientiﬁc knowledge, either as part of scholarly articles or as standalone ob jects. However, workﬂows are not born to be reliable, which can seriously damage their reusability and trustworthiness as knowledge exchange instruments. Scientiﬁc workﬂows are commonly sub ject to decay, which consequently undermines their reliability over their lifetime. The reliability of workﬂows can be notably improved by advocating scientists to preserve a minimal set of information that is essential to assist the interpretations of these workﬂows and hence improve their potential for reproducibility and reusability. In this paper we show how, by measuring and monitoring the completeness and stability of scientiﬁc workﬂows over time we are able to provide scientists with a measure of their reliability, supporting the reuse of trustworthy scientiﬁc knowledge.",Semantic Web In Use Track Paper,,0,,0,Esteban García-Cuesta;José Manuel Gómez-Pérez;Aleix Garrido;José Enrique Ruiz,4,"https://github.com/lidingpku/iswc-archive/raw/master/paper/iswc-2013/82190081-when-history-matters-assessing-reliability-for-the-reuse-of-scientific-workflows.pdf,http://www.springer.com/computer/ai/book/978-3-642-41337-7",2
