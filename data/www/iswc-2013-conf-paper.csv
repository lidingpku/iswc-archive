At over 31 billion triples in 2011, querying this globally distributed data space poses several scalability challenges. One critical aspect when processing distributed SPARQL queries is given by the number and type of distributed joins needed. Traditionally, query optimizers alleviate this issue by attempting to find an optimal query plan assuming a given and fixed data distribution. Discarding this fixed data partitioning assumption, offers the opportunity to create a data distribution that minimizes the number of distributed joins. Recent research focused on data- and query-driven partitioning strategies for both RDF and relational data. In this paper we propose a novel and naive workload-driven approach to data partitioning and investigate the impact of various critical factors on the number of resulting distributed joins. In a preliminary experiment we empirically compare our method to traditional partitioning strategies using a DBpedia query log of 400’000 queries and observe that it can produce up to 50% less distributed joins than an expert (manual) partitioning scheme, 45% less than partitioning based on hashing by subject and up to 83% less distributed joins than just random assignment.",Poster/Demo Paper,,0,,0,Cosmin Basca;Abraham Bernstein,2,,0

Towards this objective, we propose a novel approach of indexing concepts using ontology axioms in an inverted file structure and ranking them using a dynamic ranking algorithm.

Then in the contextual tag cloud, the font size of each tag depends on the number of instances that are associated with that tag and all tags in the context. Each contextual tag cloud serves as a summary of the distribution of relevant data, and by changing the context, the user can quickly gain an understanding of patterns in the data. Furthermore, the user can choose to include RDFS taxonomic and/or domain/range entailment in the calculations of tag sizes, thereby understanding the impact of semantics on the data.

To ensure scalability most distributed systems partition the data and distribute the workload among multiple machines. This approach does, however, raise the question how the data and the workload should be partitioned and distributed. A uniform scheduling strategy---a uniform distribution of computation load among available machines---typically used by stream processing systems, disregards network-load as one of the major bottlenecks for throughput resulting in an immense load in terms of inter-machine communication. We propose a graph-partitioning based approach for workload scheduling within stream processing systems.We implemented a distributed triple-stream processing engine on top of the Storm realtime computation framework and evaluate its communication behavior using two real-world datasets. We show that the application of graph partitioning algorithms can decrease inter-machine communication substantially (by 40% to 99%) whilst maintaining an even workload distribution, even using very limited data statistics. We also find that processing RDF data as single triples at a time rather than graph fragments (containing multiple triples), may decrease throughput indicating the usefulness of semantics.",Poster/Demo Paper,,0,,0,Thomas Scharrenbach;Lorenz Fischer;Abraham Bernstein,3,,0

Theexploitation of available background knowledge is a key element in this scenario.In this paper we introduce a novel method for the semantic interpretation of humanbehavior in mobility based on the merge of the mobile network data streamand the geo-referred available background knowledge. We modeled the humanbehavior making use of the geo and time-referenced knowledge available on theweb (e.g., geo-tagged resources, info on weather forecast, social events, etc.)matching it with the mobile network coverage map. The model is intended tocharacterize the contexts where the mobile network events occur in order to helpin interpreting the behavioral traits that generated by them. This will allow us toachieve a set of predictive tasks such as the prediction of human activities in certain contextual conditions (e.g., when an accident occurs on highway before theworking time starts, etc.), or the characterization of exceptional events detectedfrom anomalies in mobile network data.We created an ontological and stochastic high-level representation behavioralmodel (HRBModel) that maps the human activities to the different contexts.Given the mobile phone network and the geo-tagged resource Openstreetmap,the model is used to rank the activities associated to a particular network event(e.g. a sudden call amount peak) according to their probability.

For users, the key question is how often they will encounter those pathological inputs in practice, that is, how robust are reasoners. We attempt to determine this question for classification of existing ontologies as they are found on the Web. It is a fairly common user task to examine ontologies published on the Web as part of their development process. Thus, the robustness of reasoners in this scenario is both directly interesting and provides some hints toward answering the broader question.

The focus of our study is on improving diabetes patient selection for clinical trials or medical research. The biggest impediment to automating such clinical tasks is the essential requirement of bridging the semantic gaps between existing patient data from electronic health records, such as reasons for visit, chronic conditions and diagnoses from practice notes, pathology tests and prescriptions stored in general practice information systems, and the ways which researchers or general practitioners interpret those records. Our current comprehension is that automation of identifying diabetes patients for clinical or research purposes can be specified systematically as a solution supported by semantic retrieval. We detail the challenges to build a realistic case study, which consists of solving issues related to conceptualization of data and domain context, integration of different datasets, ontology creation based on SNOMED CT-AU® standard, mapping between existing data and ontology, and dilemma of data fitness for research use.

Most of the related work focuses on automatic annotation with classes or properties of source attributes or input and output parameters. However, constructing a source model that includes the relationships between the attributes in addition to their semantic types remains a largely unsolved problem. In this paper, we present a graph-based approach to hypothesize a rich semantic description of a new target source from a set of known sources that have been modeled over the same domain ontology. We exploit the domain ontology and the known source models to build a graph that represents the space of plausible source descriptions. Then, we compute the top k candidates and suggest to the user a ranked list of the semantic models for the new source. The approach takes into account user corrections to learn more accurate semantic descriptions of future data sources.

Our goal is to provide CQE algorithms that (i) ensure conﬁdentiality of sensitive information; (ii) are eﬃciently implementable by means of RDF triple store technologies; and (iii) ensure maximality of the answers returned by the system to user queries (thus restricting access to information as little as possible). We formally show that these requirements are in conﬂict and cannot be satisﬁed without imposing restrictions on ontologies. We propose a fragment of OWL 2 RL for which all three requirements can be satisﬁed. For the identiﬁed fragment, we design a CQE algorithm that has the same computational complexity as standard query answering and can be implemented by relying on state-of-the-art triple stores.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Dmitriy Zheleznyakov;Evgeny Kharlamov;Bernardo Cuenca Grau;Egor V.

Due to the decentralised architecture of this compendium, several of these datasets contain duplicated data. Yet, so far, only little attention has been paid to the eﬀect of duplicated data on federated querying. This work presents DAW, a novel duplicate-aware approach to federated querying over the Web of Data. DAW is based on a combination of min-wise independent permutations and compact data summaries. It can be directly combined with existing federated query engines in order to achieve the same query recall values while querying fewer data sources. We extend three well-known federated query processing engines – DARQ, SPLENDID, and FedX – with DAW and compare our extensions with the original approaches. The comparison shows that DAW can greatly reduce the number of queries sent to the endpoints, while keeping high query recall values. Therefore, it can signiﬁcantly improve the performance of federated query processing engines. Moreover, DAW provides a source selection mechanism that maximises the query recall, when the query processing is limited to a subset of the sources.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Muhammad Saleem;Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo;Helena Deus;Josiane Xavier Parreira;Manfred Hauswirth,5,"https://github.com/lidingpku/iswc-archive/raw/master/paper/iswc-2013/82180561.pdf,http://www.springer.com/computer/ai/book/978-3-642-41334-6",2

However, quite a few hyperlinks have not been anotated by editors in infoboxes, which causes lots of relations between entities being missing in Wikipedia. In this paper, we propose an approach for automatically discovering the missing entity links in Wikipedia’s infoboxes, so that the missing semantic relations between entities can be established.

A learning model is used to obtain the weights of diﬀerent features, and predict the destination entity for each attribute value.

In this context, materializing every possible implicit derivation from a given input can be computationally expensive, especially when considering large data volumes. Most of the solutions that address this problem rely on the assumption that the information is static, i.e., that it does not change, or changes very infrequently. However, the Web is extremely dynamic: online newspapers, blogs, social networks, etc., are frequently changed so that outdated information is removed and replaced with fresh data. This demands for a materialization that is not only scalable, but also reactive to changes. In this paper, we consider the problem of incremental materialization, that is, how to update the materialized derivations when new data is added or removed. To this purpose, we consider the ρdf RDFS fragment [12], and present a parallel system that implements a number of algorithms to quickly recalculate the derivation. In case new data is added, our system uses a parallel version of the well-known semi-naive evaluation of Datalog. In case of removals, we have implemented two algorithms, one based on previous theoretical work, and another one that is more eﬃcient since it does not require a complete scan of the input. We have evaluated the performance using a prototype system called DynamiTE , which organizes the knowledge bases with a number of indices to facilitate the query process and exploits parallelism to improve the performance. The results show that our methods are indeed capable to recalculate the derivation in a short time, opening the door to reasoning on much more dynamic data than is currently possible.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Alessandro Margara;Ceriel Jacobs;Frank Van Harmelen;Jacopo Urbani;Henri Bal,5,"https://github.com/lidingpku/iswc-archive/raw/master/paper/iswc-2013/82180641.pdf,http://www.springer.com/computer/ai/book/978-3-642-41334-6",2

Here we consider three logically sound notions of modules: MEX modules, only applicable to inexpressive ontologies; modules based on semantic locality, a sound approximation of the ﬁrst; and modules based on syntactic locality, a sound approximation of the second (and thus the ﬁrst), widely used since these modules can be extracted from OWL DL ontologies in time polynomial in the size of the ontology. In this paper we investigate the quality of both approximations over a large corpus of ontologies, using our own implementation of semantic locality, which is the ﬁrst to our knowledge. In particular, we show with statistical signiﬁcance that, in most cases, there is no diﬀerence between the two module notions based on locality; where they diﬀer, the additional axioms can either be easily ruled out or their number is relatively small. We classify the axioms that explain the rare diﬀerences into four kinds of “culprits” and discuss which of those can be avoided by extending the deﬁnition of syntactic locality. Finally, we show that diﬀerences between MEX and locality-based modules occur for a minority of ontologies from our corpus and largely aﬀect (approximations of ) expressive ontologies – this conclusion relies on a much larger and more diverse sample than existing comparisons between MEX and syntactic locality-based modules.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Bijan Parsia;Pavel Klinov;Thomas Schneider;Dmitry Tsarkov;Chiara Del Vescovo;Ulrike Sattler,6,"https://github.com/lidingpku/iswc-archive/raw/master/paper/iswc-2013/82180081.pdf,http://www.springer.com/computer/ai/book/978-3-642-41334-6",2

Of particular interest is entity search, where the units of retrieval are structured entities instead of textual documents. These entities reside in diﬀerent sources, which may provide only limited information about their content and are therefore called “uncooperative”. Further, these sources capture complementary but also redundant information about entities. In this environment of uncooperative data sources, we study the problem of federated entity search, where redundant information about entities is reduced on-the-ﬂy through entity consolidation performed at query time. We propose a novel method for entity consolidation that is based on using language models and completely unsupervised, hence more suitable for this on-the-ﬂy uncooperative setting than state-of-the-art methods that require training data. Further, we apply the same language model technique to deal with the federated search problem of ranking results returned from diﬀerent sources.

How does she know which ontology is the most relevant to her search? Our research group hosts BioPortal, a public repository of more than 330 ontologies in the biomedical domain. When a term that a user searches for is available in multiple ontologies, how do we rank the results and how do we measure how well our ranking works? In this paper, we develop an evaluation framework that enables developers to compare and analyze the performance of diﬀerent ontology-ranking methods. Our framework is based on processing search logs and determining how often users select the top link that the search engine oﬀers. We evaluate our framework by analyzing the data on BioPortal searches. We explore several diﬀerent ranking algorithms and measure the eﬀectiveness of each ranking by measuring how often users click on the highest ranked ontology. We collected log data from more than 4,800 BioPortal searches. Our results show that regardless of the ranking, in more than half the searches, users select the ﬁrst link. Thus, it is even more critical to ensure that the ranking is appropriate if we want to have satisﬁed users.

The contextual tag cloud system is a novel application that helps users explore a large scale RDF dataset: the tags are ontological terms (classes and properties), the context is a set of tags that deﬁnes a subset of instances, and the font sizes reﬂect the number of instances that use each tag. It visualizes the patterns of instances speciﬁed by the context a user constructs. Given a request with a speciﬁc context, the system needs to quickly ﬁnd what other tags the instances in the context use, and how many instances in the context use each tag.

This is complicated by the fact that the calculation should, when directed by the user, consider the entailment of taxonomic and/or domain/range axioms in the ontology.

Addressing this task is especially challenging when dealing with geo-spatial datasets due to their sheer size and the potential complexity of single geo-spatial objects. Yet, so far, little attention has been paid to the characteristics of geo-spatial data within the context of link discovery. In this paper, we address this gap by presenting Orchid, a reduction-ratio-optimal link discovery approach designed especially for geo-spatial data. Orchid relies on a combination of the Hausdorﬀ and orthodromic metrics to compute the distance between geo-spatial objects. We ﬁrst present two novel approaches for the eﬃcient computation of Hausdorﬀ distances. Then, we present the space tiling approach implemented by Orchid and prove that it is optimal with respect to the reduction ratio that it can achieve. The evaluation of our approaches is carried out on three real datasets of diﬀerent size and complexity. Our results suggest that our approaches to the computation of Hausdorﬀ distances require two orders of magnitude less orthodromic distances computations to compare geographical data. Moreover, they require two orders of magnitude less time than a naive approach to achieve this goal. Finally, our results indicate that Orchid scales to large datasets while outperforming the state of the art signiﬁcantly.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo,1,"http://www.springer.com/computer/ai/book/978-3-642-41334-6,https://github.com/lidingpku/iswc-archive/raw/master/paper/iswc-2013/82180385.pdf",2

A common problem is the imprecision in the use of vocabularies: annotators can misunderstand the semantics of a class or property or may not be able to ﬁnd the right objects to annotate with. This decreases the quality of data and may eventually hamper its usability over large scale. This paper describes Statistical Knowledge Patterns (SKP) as a means to address this issue. SKPs encapsulate key information about ontology classes, including synonymous properties in (and across) datasets, and are automatically generated based on statistical data analysis. SKPs can be eﬀectively used to automatically normalise data, and hence increase recall in querying. Both pattern extraction and pattern usage are completely automated. The main beneﬁts of SKPs are that: (1) their structure allows for both accurate query expansion and restriction; (2) they are context dependent, hence they describe the usage and meaning of properties in the context of a particular class; and (3) they can be generated oﬄine, hence the equivalence among relations can be used eﬃciently at run time.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Ziqi Zhang;Fabio Ciravegna;Anna Lisa Gentile;Eva Blomqvist;Isabelle Augenstein,5,"http://www.springer.com/computer/ai/book/978-3-642-41334-6,https://github.com/lidingpku/iswc-archive/raw/master/paper/iswc-2013/82180687.pdf",2

For this reason, Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs) increasingly contain information about the searched entities such as pictures, short summaries, related entities, and factual information. A key facet that is often displayed on the SERPs and that is instrumental for many applications is the entity type. However, an entity is usually not associated to a single generic type in the background knowledge bases but rather to a set of more speciﬁc types, which may be relevant or not given the document context. For example, one can ﬁnd on the Linked Open Data cloud the fact that Tom Hanks is a person, an actor, and a person from Concord, California. All those types are correct but some may be too general to be interesting (e.g., person), while other may be interesting but already known to the user (e.g., actor), or may be irrelevant given the current browsing context (e.g., person from Concord, California). In this paper, we deﬁne the new task of ranking entity types given an entity and its context. We propose and evaluate new methods to ﬁnd the most relevant entity type based on collection statistics and on the graph structure interconnecting entities and types. An extensive experimental evaluation over several document collections at diﬀerent levels of granularity (e.g., sentences, paragraphs, etc.) and diﬀerent type hierarchies (including DBPedia, Freebase, and schema.org) shows that hierarchy-based approaches provide more accurate results when picking entity types to be displayed to the end-user while still being highly scalable.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Gianluca Demartini;Karl Aberer;Michele Catasta;Alberto Tonon;Philippe Cudré-Mauroux,5,"https://github.com/lidingpku/iswc-archive/raw/master/paper/iswc-2013/82180625.pdf,http://www.springer.com/computer/ai/book/978-3-642-41334-6",2

However, the number of accomplished mappings is still small and limited to most frequent infoboxes. Furthermore, mappings need maintenance due to the constant and quick changes of Wikipedia articles.

It is frequently unclear, however, to what degree extralogical ontology errors negatively affect the application that the ontology underpins. For example, “Shoe SubClassOf Foot” may be correct logically, but not in a human interpretation. Indeed, such errors, not caught by reasoning, are likely to be domain-speciﬁc, and thus identifying salient ontology errors requires consideration of the domain. There are both automated and manual methods that provide ontology quality assurance. Nevertheless, these methods do not readily scale as ontology size increases, and do not necessarily identify the most salient extralogical errors. Recently, crowdsourcing has enabled solutions to complex problems that computers alone cannot solve. For instance, human workers can quickly and more accurately identify objects in images at scale. Crowdsourcing presents an opportunity to develop methods for ontology quality assurance that overcome the current limitations of scalability and applicability. In this work, I aim (1) to determine the effect of extralogical ontology errors in an example domain, (2) to develop a scalable framework for crowdsourcing ontology veriﬁcation that overcomes current ontology Q/A method limitations, and (3) to apply this framework to ontologies in use. I will then evaluate the method itself and also its effect in the context of a speciﬁc domain. As an example domain, I will use biomedicine, which applies many large-scale ontologies.

Semantic web technologies should be ideal for exploring the complex networks of genes, proteins and metabolites that interact, but much of this data is not natively available to the semantic web. Data is typically collected and stored with free-text annotations in spreadsheets, many of which do not conform to existing metadata standards and are often not publica lly released. Along with initiatives to promote more data sharing, one of the main challenges is therefore to semantically annotate and extract this data so that it is available to the research community. Data annotation and curation are expensive and undervalued tasks that have enormous benefits to the discipline as a whole, but fewer benefits to the individual data producers. By embedding semantic annotation into spreadsheets, however, and automat ically extracting this data into RDF at the time of repository submission, the process of producing standards-compliant data, that is available for semantic web querying, can be achieved without adding additional overheads to laboratory data management. This paper describes these strategies in the context of semantic data management in the SEEK.

While metadata and ontologies help overcome the problems of finding and interpreting data, the lack of clarity over licensing remains a real impediment to data reuse. Freedom from legal restriction and uncertainty is essential for the effective sharing, combining and deriving of data from these distributed collections. Reuse and recombination of data will be greatly facilitated by expanding the definition of the semantic web to include the semantics of data licensing. We aim to express licensing terms in a computable manner, within the context of research practice, enabling us to infer the resulting state of rights, obligations and conditions that are inherited by derived and recombined datasets, using a mixed bag of licenses. Building off this we aim to simulate the effects of varying licensing practices within communities, proposing a measure of health of our scholarly record based on compatibility and restrictiveness of the licenses contained therein.",Doctoral Consortium Paper,,0,,0,Mark Gahegan;Richard Hosking,2,"http://www.springer.com/computer/ai/book/978-3-642-41337-7,https://github.com/lidingpku/iswc-archive/raw/master/paper/iswc-2013/82190425.pdf",2

It takes as inputs an ontology and a query written according to that ontology, and produces as an output a set of queries that should be evaluated to account for the inferences that should be considered for that query and ontology. Diﬀerent query rewriting systems give support to diﬀerent ontology languages with varying expressiveness, and the rewritten queries obtained as an output do also vary in expressiveness. This heterogeneity has traditionally made it diﬃcult to compare diﬀerent approaches, and the area lacks in general commonly agreed benchmarks that could be used not only for such comparisons but also for improving OBDA support. In this paper we compile data, dimensions and measurements that have been used to evaluate some of the most recent systems, we analyse and characterise these assets, and provide a uniﬁed set of them that could be used as a starting point towards a more systematic benchmarking process for such systems.

However, the impact of research and development generated by European countries on economic, educational and healthcare performance is poorly understood. The recent Linking Open Data (LOD) project has made a lot of data sources publicly available and in human-readable formats. In this paper, we demonstrate the utility of LOD in assessing the impact of Research and Development (R&D) on the economic, education and healthcare performance in Europe. We extract relevant variables from two LOD datasets, namely World Bank and Eurostat. We analyze the data for 20 out of the 27 European countries over a span of 10 years (1999 to 2009). We use a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) approach to quantify the impact of R&D on the different measures. We perform different exploratory and conﬁrmatory factorial analysis evaluations which gives rise to four latent variables that are included in the model: (i) Research and Development (R&D), (ii) Economic Performance (EcoP), (iii) Educational Performance (EduP), (iv) Healthcare performance (HcareP) of the European countries. Our results indicate the importance of R&D to the overall development of the European educational and healthcare performance (directly) and economic performance (indirectly). The results also shows the practical applicability of LOD to estimate this impact.",Semantic Web In Use Track Paper,,0,,0,Cinzia Daraio;Ricardo Pietrobon;Joao Ricardo Nickenig Vissoci;Amrapali Zaveri,4,"https://github.com/lidingpku/iswc-archive/raw/master/paper/iswc-2013/82190241.pdf,http://www.springer.com/computer/ai/book/978-3-642-41337-7",2

Health oﬃcials use ICD in all United Nations member countries to compile basic health statistics, to monitor health-related spending, and to inform policy makers. In 2010, we published a paper in the ISWC In Use track reporting on our experience in the ﬁrst six months with building and deploying iCAT, a Semantic Web platform to support the collaborative authoring of ICD-11. Three years since our original publication, 270 domain experts around the world have used iCAT to author more than 45,000 classes, to perform more than 260,000 changes, and to create more than 17,000 links to external medical terminologies. During the last three years, the collaboration processes, modeling and tooling have evolved signiﬁcantly, and we have learned important lessons, which we will report in this paper. We describe the beneﬁts of using semantic technologies as an infrastructure, which proved to be critical in making support for this rapid evolution possible. To our knowledge, this eﬀort is the only real-world pro ject supporting the collaborative authoring of ontologies at this scale, and which, at the same time, has a high visibility and impact for the health care around the world.
