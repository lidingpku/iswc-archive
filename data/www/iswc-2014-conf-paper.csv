Proceedings, Part I","Semantic Web technologies are used in a variety of domains for their ability to facilitate data integration, as well as enabling expressive, standards-based reasoning. Deploying Semantic Web reasoning processes directly on mobile devices has a number of advantages, including robustness to connectivity loss, more timely results, and reduced infrastructure requirements. At the same time, a number of challenges arise as well, related to mobile platform heterogeneity and limited computing resources. To tackle these challenges, it should be possible to benchmark mobile reasoning performance across different mobile platforms, with rule- and datasets of varying scale and complexity and existing reasoning process flows. To deal with the current heterogeneity of rule formats, a uniform rule- and data-interface on top of mobile reasoning engines should be provided as well. In this paper, we present a cross-platform benchmark framework that supplies 1) a generic, standards-based Semantic Web layer on top of existing mobile reasoning engines; and 2) a benchmark engine to investigate and compare mobile reasoning performance.","Replication, Benchmark, Data and Software Track Paper",,0,,0,Newres Al Haider;Syed Sr Abidi;Ahmad Ahmad;William Van Woensel,4,https://github.com/lidingpku/iswc2014/raw/master/paper/87960385-a-cross-platform-benchmarking-framework-for-mobile-semantic-web-reasoning-engines.pdf,1

We validate our methodology by applying it to three well-known reasoners and rule engines answering queries on two ontologies with expressivities in RDFS and OWL DL. While this validation was conducted on smartphones running Google’s Android operating system, our methodology is general and may be applied to different hardware platforms, reasoners, ontologies, and entire applications to determine performance relevant to power consumption. We discuss the implications of our findings for balancing tradeoffs of local computation versus communication costs for semantic technologies on mobile platforms, sensor networks, the Internet of Things, and other power-constrained environments.","Replication, Benchmark, Data and Software Track Paper",,0,,0,Evan Patton;Deborah McGuinness,2,https://github.com/lidingpku/iswc2014/raw/master/paper/87960401-a-power-consumption-benchmark-for-reasoners-on-mobile-devices.pdf,1

Proceedings, Part I","Over the last decades, several billion Web pages have been made available on the Web. The ongoing transition from the current Web of unstructured data to the Web of Data yet requires scalable and accurate approaches for the extraction of structured data in RDF (Resource Description Framework) from these websites. One of the key steps towards extracting RDF from text is the disambiguation of named entities. While several approaches aim to tackle this problem, they still achieve poor accuracy. We address this drawback by presenting AGDISTIS, a novel knowledge-base-agnostic approach for named entity disambiguation. Our approach combines the Hypertext-Induced Topic Search (HITS) algorithm with label expansion strategies and string similarity measures. Based on this combination, AGDISTIS can efficiently detect the correct URIs for a given set of named entities within an input text. We evaluate our approach on eight different datasets against state-of-theart named entity disambiguation frameworks. Our results indicate that we outperform the state-of-the-art approach by up to 29% F-measure.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Sandro Athaide Coelho;Andreas Both;Daniel Gerber;Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo;Sören Auer;Ricardo Usbeck;Michael Röder,7,https://github.com/lidingpku/iswc2014/raw/master/paper/87960449-agdistis-graph-based-disambiguation-of-named-entities-using-linked-data.pdf,1

In 2011, the State of the LOD Cloud report analyzed the adoption of these best practices by linked datasets within different topical domains. The report was based on information that was provided by the dataset publishers themselves via the datahub.io Linked Data catalog. In this paper, we revisit and update the findings of the 2011 State of the LOD Cloud report based on a crawl of the Web of Linked Data conducted in April 2014. We analyze how the adoption of the different best practices has changed and present an overview of the linkage relationships between datasets in the form of an updated LOD cloud diagram, this time not based on information from dataset providers, but on data that can actually be retrieved by a Linked Data crawler. Among others, we find that the number of linked datasets has approximately doubled between 2011 and 2014, that there is increased agreement on common vocabularies for describing certain types of entities, and that provenance and license metadata is still rarely provided by the data sources.","Replication, Benchmark, Data and Software Track Paper",,0,,0,Max Schmachtenberg;Heiko Paulheim;Christian Bizer,3,https://github.com/lidingpku/iswc2014/raw/master/paper/87960241-adoption-of-linked-data-best-practices-in-different-topical-domains.pdf,1

Proceedings, Part I","Linked Open Data faces severe issues of scalability, availability and data quality. These issues are observed by data consumers performing federated queries; SPARQL endpoints do not respond and results can be wrong or out-of-date. If a data consumer finds an error, how can she fix it? This raises the issue of the writability of Linked Data. In this paper, we devise an extension of the federation of Linked Data to data consumers. A data consumer can make partial copies of different datasets and make them available through a SPARQL endpoint. A data consumer can update her local copy and share updates with data providers and consumers. Update sharing improves general data quality, and replicated data creates opportunities for federated query engines to improve availability. However, when updates occur in an uncontrolled way, consistency issues arise. In this paper, we define fragments as SPARQL CONSTRUCT federated queries and propose a correction criterion to maintain these fragments incrementally without reevaluating the query. We define a coordination free protocol based on the counting of triples derivations and provenance. We analyze the theoretical complexity of the protocol in time, space and traffic. Experimental results suggest the scalability of our approach to Linked Data.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Luis-Daniel Ibáñez;Hala Skaf-Molli;Olivier Corby;Pascal Molli,4,https://github.com/lidingpku/iswc2014/raw/master/paper/87960321-col-graph-towards-writable-and-scalable-linked-open-data.pdf,1

In this work, we instead propose an approach which combines the outcomes of two independent outlier detection runs to get a more reliable result and to also prevent problems arising from natural outliers which are exceptional values in the dataset but nevertheless correct. Linked Data is especially suited for the application of such an idea, since it provides large amounts of data enriched with hierarchical information and also contains explicit links between instances. In a first step, we apply outlier detection methods to the property values extracted from a single repository, using a novel approach for splitting the data into relevant subsets. For the second step, we exploit owl:sameAs links for the instances to get additional property values and perform a second outlier detection on these values. Doing so allows us to confirm or reject the assessment of a wrong value.

As RDF data continue to be published across heterogeneous domains and integrated at Web-scale such as in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud, RDF data management systems are being exposed to queries that are far more diverse and workloads that are far more varied. The first contribution of our work is an indepth experimental analysis that shows existing SPARQL benchmarks are not suitable for testing systems for diverse queries and varied workloads. To address these shortcomings, our second contribution is the Waterloo SPARQL Diversity Test Suite (WatDiv) that provides stress testing tools for RDF data management systems. Using WatDiv, we have been able to reveal issues with existing systems that went unnoticed in evaluations using earlier benchmarks. Specifically, our experiments with five popular RDF data management systems show that they cannot deliver good performance uniformly across workloads. For some queries, there can be as much as five orders of magnitude difference between the query execution time of the fastest and the slowest system while the fastest system on one query may unexpectedly time out on another query.

The hypothesis is that similar drugs interact with the same targets, and similar targets interact with the same drugs. The similarities between drugs reflect a chemical semantic space, while similarities between targets reflect a genomic semantic space. In this paper, we present a novel method that combines a data mining framework for link prediction, semantic knowledge (similarities) from ontologies or semantic spaces, and an algorithmic approach to partition the edges of a heterogeneous graph that includes drug-target interaction edges, and drug-drug and target-target similarity edges. Our semantics based edge partitioning approach, semEP, has the advantages of edge based community detection which allows a node to participate in more than one cluster or community. The semEP problem is to create a minimal partitioning of the edges such that the cluster density of each subset of edges is maximal. We use semantic knowledge (similarities) to specify edge constraints, i.e., specific drug-target interaction edges that should not participate in the same cluster. Using a well-known dataset of drug-target interactions, we demonstrate the benefits of using semEP predictions to improve the performance of a range of state-of-the-art machine learning based prediction methods.

To close the gap between the lightweight LOD and the expressive ontologies, we contribute to the complementary part of the LOD, that is, Linking Open Schema (LOS). In this paper, we introduce Zhishi.schema, the first effort to publish Chinese linked open schema. We collect navigational categories as well as dynamic tags from more than 50 various most popular social Web sites in China. We then propose a two-stage method to capture equivalence, subsumption and relate relationships between the collected categories and tags, which results in an integrated concept taxonomy and a large semantic network. Experimental results show the high quality of Zhishi.schema. Compared with category systems of DBpedia, Yago, BabelNet, and Freebase, Zhishi.schema has wide coverage of categories and contains the largest number of subsumptions between categories. When substituting Zhishi.schema for the original category system of Zhishi.me, we not only filter out incorrect category subsumptions but also add more finer-grained categories.","Replication, Benchmark, Data and Software Track Paper",,0,,0,Tong Ruan;Guilin Qi;Haofen Wang;Tianxing Wu,4,https://github.com/lidingpku/iswc2014/raw/master/paper/87960289-on-publishing-chinese-linked-open-schema.pdf,1

Proceedings, Part I","The recent big data movement resulted in a surge of activity on layering declarative languages on top of distributed computation platforms. In the Semantic Web realm, this surge of analytics languages was not reflected despite the significant growth in the available RDF data. Consequently, when analysing large RDF datasets, users are left with two main options: using SPARQL or using an existing non-RDF-specific big data language, both with its own limitations. The pure declarative nature of SPARQL and the high cost of evaluation can be limiting in some scenarios. On the other hand, existing big data languages are designed mainly for tabular data and, therefore, applying them to RDF data results in verbose, unreadable, and sometimes inefficient scripts. In this paper, we introduce SYRql, a dataflow language designed to process RDF data at a large scale. SYRql blends concepts from both SPARQL and existing big data languages. We formally define a closed algebra that underlies SYRql and discuss its properties and some unique optimisation opportunities this algebra provides.

With the adoption of the recent SPARQL 1.1 standard, however, RDF databases are capable of answering much more expressive queries directly, and we ask how this can be exploited in query rewriting. We find that SPARQL 1.1 is powerful enough to “implement” a full-fledged OWL QL reasoner in a single query.

Semano generalizes the mechanism of JAPE transducers that has been introduced within the General Architecture for Text Engineering (GATE) to enable modular development of annotation rule bases. The core of the Semano rule base model are rule templates called japelates and their instantiations. While Semano is generic and does not make assumptions about the document characteristics used within japelates, it provides several generic japelates that can serve as a starting point. Also, Semano provides a tool that can generate an initial rule base from an ontology. The generated rule base can be easily extended to meet the requirements of the application in question. In addition to its Java API, Semano includes two GUI components — a rule base editor and an annotation viewer. In combination with the default japelates and the rule generator, these GUI components can be used by domain experts that are not familiar with the technical details of the framework to set up a domain-specific annotator.

Instead of the traditional inter-annotator agreement, we use their disagreement as a useful signal to evaluate the data quality, ambiguity and vagueness.

An application domain may have been modeled according to different points of view and purposes. This situation usually leads to the development of different ontologies that intuitively overlap, but that use different naming and modeling conventions. The problem of (semi-)automatically computing mappings between indepen- dently developed ontologies is usually referred to as the ontology matching prob- lem. A number of sophisticated ontology matching systems have been developed in the last years [5, 30]. These systems, however, rely on lexical and structural heuristics, and the integration of the input ontologies and the mappings may lead to many undesired logical consequences. In [13] three principles were pro- posed to minimise the number of potentially unintended consequences, namely: (i) consistency principle, the mappings should not lead to unsatisfiable classes in the integrated ontology, (ii) locality principle, the mappings should link enti- ties that have similar neighbourhoods, (iii) conservativity principle, the mappings should not introduce new semantic relationships between concepts from one of the input ontologies. Violations to these principles may hinder the usefulness of ontology mappings.

Each cluster is labeled with an ontological pattern, which gives a conceptual summary of the associations in the cluster. Facet values comprise classes of entities and relations appearing in associations.

Collapsing the strongly connected components into single nodes yields a condensed hypergraph that comprises a representation of the atomic decomposition of the ontology. To speed up the condensation of the hypergraph, we first reduce its size by collapsing the strongly connected components of its graph fragment employing a linear time graph algorithm. This approach helps to significantly reduce the time needed for computing the atomic decomposition of an ontology.

In some ontology-based applications, e.g., for ontology debugging, knowing the logical consequences of the ontology axioms is often not sufficient. The user also needs to know from which axioms and how the consequences were derived. Although it is possible to record all inference steps during the application of rules, this is usually not done in practice to avoid the overheads. In this paper, we present a goal-directed method that can generate inferences for selected consequences in the deductive closure without re-applying all rules from scratch.

Proceedings, Part II","Much of the recent work in Semantic Search is concerned with addressing the challenge of finding entities in the growing Web of Data. However, alongside this growth, there is a significant increase in the availability of ontologies that can be used to describe these entities. Whereas several methods have been proposed in Semantic Search to rank entities based on a keyword query, little work has been published on search and ranking of resources in ontologies. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to propose a benchmark suite for ontology search. The benchmark suite, named CBRBench3, includes a collection of ontologies that was retrieved by crawling a seed set of ontology URIs derived from prefix.cc and a set of queries derived from a real query log from the Linked Open Vocabularies search engine. Further, it includes the results for the ideal ranking of the concepts in the ontology collection for the identified set of query terms which was established based on the opinions of ten ontology engineering experts. We compared this ideal ranking with the top-k results retrieved by eight state-of-the-art ranking algorithms that we have implemented and calculated the precision at k, the mean average precision and the discounted cumulative gain to determine the best performing ranking model. Our study shows that content-based ranking models outperform graph-based ranking models for most queries on the task of ranking concepts in ontologies. However, as the performance of the ranking models on ontologies is still far inferior to the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms on the ranking of documents based on a keyword query, we put forward four recommendations that we believe can significantly improve the accuracy of these ranking models when searching for resources in ontologies.","Replication, Benchmark, Data and Software Track Paper",,0,,0,Anila Sahar Butt;Armin Haller;Lexing Xie,3,https://github.com/lidingpku/iswc2014/raw/master/paper/87970129-ontology-search-an-empirical-evaluation.pdf,1

To address this issue, this paper presents a unified data integration framework for resourceconstrained mobile devices. Our generic, extensible framework not only provides a unified view of personal data from different personal information data spaces but also can run on a user’s mobile device without any external server. To save processing resources, we propose a data normalisation approach that can deal with ID-consolidation and ambiguity issues without complex generic reasoning.

However the automatic topic classification of social media content pose various challenges. Topic classification is a common technique used for automatically capturing themes that emerge from social media streams. However, such techniques are sensitive to the evolution of topics when new event-dependent vocabularies start to emerge (e.g., Crimea becoming relevant to War Conflict during the Ukraine crisis in 2014). Therefore, traditional supervised classification methods which rely on labelled data could rapidly become outdated. In this paper we propose a novel transfer learning approach to address the classification task of new data when the only available labelled data belong to a previous epoch.

We present a standard-compliant solution that does not require changes to the current syntax or semantics of the language, based on the use of a call function. In contrast to the plain “Extensible Value Testing” described in the W3C Recommendations for the sparql Query Language, our approach is interoperable, that is, not dependent on the specific implementation of the endpoint being used for the query, relying instead on the implementation of the endpoint that declares and makes the function available, therefore reducing interoperability issues to one single case for which we provide an open source implementation. Further, the proposed solution for using custom functions within sparql queries is quite expressive, allowing for true higher-order functions, where functions can be assigned to variables and used as both inputs and outputs, enabling a generation of Web APIs for sparql that we call Web of Functions. The paper also shows different approaches on how our proposal can be applied to existing endpoints, including a SPARQL-to-SPARQL compiler that makes the use of call unnecessary, by exploiting nonnormative sections in the Federated Query W3C Recommendations that are currently implemented on some popular sparql engines. We finally evaluate the effectiveness of our proposal reporting our experiments on two popular engines.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Maurizio Atzori,1,https://github.com/lidingpku/iswc2014/raw/master/paper/87970401-toward-the-web-of-functions-interoperable-higher-order-functions-in-sparql.pdf,1

Proceedings, Part II","BioPortal is a repository for biomedical ontologies that also includes mappings between them from various sources. Considered as a whole, these mappings may cause logical errors, due to incompatibilities between the ontologies or even erroneous mappings. We have performed an automatic evaluation of BioPortal mappings between 19 ontology pairs using the mapping repair systems of LogMap and AgreementMakerLight. We found logical errors in 11 of these pairs, which on average involved 22% of the mappings between each pair. Furthermore, we conducted a manual evaluation of the repair results to identify the actual sources of error, verifying that erroneous mappings were behind over 60% of the repairs. Given the results of our analysis, we believe that annotating BioPortal mappings with information about their logical conflicts with other mappings would improve their usability for semantic web applications and facilitate the identification of erroneous mappings. In future work, we aim to collaborate with BioPortal developers in extending BioPortal with these annotations.",Semantic Web In Use Track Paper,,0,,0,Catia Pesquita;Francisco M.
