DESCRIPTION:abstract: This workshop will discuss different approach to dea
 l with uncertainty (in a wide sense) in the Semantic Web. Uncertainty is a
 n unavoidable factor in several processes\, such as knowledge interchange 
 and application interoperability\, and Semantic Web data\, which are usual
 ly incomplete\, inconsistent\, and inaccurate. This suggests the need to a
 pply different formalisms (probability\,  fuzzy logic\, decision theory\, 
 etc.) to enrich Semantic Web technologies and applications.

CATEGORY:WorkshopEvent
DESCRIPTION:abstract: The Semantic Web is growing at an enormous pace. How
 ever\, the development of semantic web software applications is not yet ma
 instream. Reasons for that include one (or more) of the following research
  issues: lack of integrated development environments (IDEs\, such as Visua
 l Studio and Eclipse)\, poor programming language support\, lack of standa
 rd testbeds and/or benchmarks\, inadequate training\, and perhaps the need
  for curricula revision. Properly addressing these issues requires interdi
 sciplinary skills\, and the collaboration between academia and industry. T
 he First Workshop on Programming the Semantic Web invites submissions that
  explore the gap between todays semantic web challenges\, particularly t
 he ones related to dealing with large amounts of data\, with the lack of a
 dequate tools. We are looking for contributions that discuss\, promote and
  further advance the programming facet of the semantic web\, including the
  development of new languages\, extension of existing ones\, and the inclu
 sion of semantic enabled capabilities into existing IDEs.

DESCRIPTION:abstract: The 2012 Joint Workshop on Scalable and High-Perform
 ance Semantic Web Systems (SSWS+HPCSW 2012) focuses on addressing the scal
 ability issue with respect to the development and deployment of systems on
  the Semantic Web. Typically\, such systems deal with information describe
 d in Semantic Web languages like OWL and RDF(S)\, and provide services suc
 h as storing\, reasoning\, querying\, analysis\, etc. There are two basic 
 requirements for these systems. First\, they have to satisfy an applicatio
 ns semantic requirements. Second\, they must scale well in order to be o
 f practical use. Given the sheer size and distributed nature of the Semant
 ic Web\, these requirements impose new challenges beyond those addressed b
 y previous systems. This joint workshop consists of two tracks regarding s
 calability: one for knowledge base systems\, and another for high-performa
 nce computing. We expect that the issue of scalability is going to challen
 ge the Semantic Web for a long period of time and significant effort is ne
 eded in order to tackle the problem. This joint workshop seeks to bring to
 gether researchers and practitioners to share their recent ideas and progr
 ess towards building scalable systems for the Semantic Web\; participants 
 from related disciplines such as Supercomputing\, and High-Performance Com
 puting\, Artificial Intelligence\, Databases\, Information Integration\, a

DESCRIPTION:abstract: The Semantic Web\, as a field\, is undergoing a majo
 r shift. After 10 years of mainly foundations-driven research\, we now see
  strong indicators that Semantic Web methods are entering mainstream techn
 ology\, in a number of forms. The consequent rise in commercial interest w
 ill likely have a fundamental impact on the field. Some established resear
 ch results will make it into mainstream applications. Others will become o
 bsolete. Radically new ideas will emerge. It is thus the right time for th
 e community to contemplate the way ahead. In this workshop\, we will provi
 de an exciting forum for the discussion of the future of the Semantic Web.
  Researchers and practitioners from all corners of the field are invited t
 o provide their insights and projections. The event will focus on discussi
 ons and the exchange of ideas\, and will use a mix of different styles of 
 interaction between the participants. It is always good to try to look ahe
 ad and anticipate the development of a field. For the Semantic Web\, it is
  now particularly important because recent developments indicate that Sema
 ntic Web technologies are entering the industrial mainstream. Schema.org a
 nd the Facebook Open Graph Protocol are bringing metadata to bear on the W
 eb large-scale. IBMs Watson and Apples Siri incorporate Semantic Techn
 ologies. Google is revamping its search approach and is going more semanti
 c in implementing their knowledge graph. And these are just a few of the p
 rominent examples. The commercial uptake will be a game-changer for the fi
 eld. It seems that only a fraction of the research results of the past ten
  years are currently being picked up. It seems that shallow semantics brin
 gs added value in many\, but not all\, application areas. In others it see
 ms that there are roadblocks for which deep semantics is required for adde
 d value  but current approaches are still limited. Linked Data and Big D
 ata are popular buzzwords right now\, but could they be hitting a peak on 
 the expectation curve? If so\, what is going to happen in the subsequent d
 ive? If not\, how will those areas affect the fields future? In this wor
 kshop\, we intend to bring together researchers from all corners of the br
 oader Semantic Web community\, to share and discuss projections of the way
  ahead in Semantic Web technologies and knowledge engineering in general.

CATEGORY:WorkshopEvent
DESCRIPTION:abstract: Ontology matching is a key interoperability enabler 
 for the Semantic Web\, as well as a useful tactic in some classical data i
 ntegration tasks dealing with the semantic heterogeneity problem. It takes
  the ontologies as input and determines as output an alignment\, that is\,
  a set of correspondences between the semantically related entities of tho
 se ontologies. These correspondences can be used for various tasks\, such 
 as ontology merging\, data translation\, query answering or navigation on 
 the web of data. Thus\, matching ontologies enables the knowledge and data
  expressed in the matched ontologies to interoperate.

DESCRIPTION:chair: Caroline Barrière\nabstract: In this tutorial\, we wil
 l start with the basics of natural language processing (NLP) and will expl
 ain different levels of analysis (segmentation\, morphology\, lexicon\, sy
 ntax\, semantic). We will then look at the specific tasks involved in mini
 ng sentences to extract resource description framework (RDF) triples and s
 how the importance that each level of language analysis can play in such t
 asks. NLP researchers have been working on such tasks for many years and h
 ave developed many algorithms to perform part-of-speech tagging\, parsing\
 , semantic disambiguation\, named entity recognition and relation extracti
 on. We will present baseline algorithms for these tasks to show expected r
 esults from state-of-the-art research. As many algorithms use machine lear
 ning (ML) techniques\, we will provide a simple introduction to the aims a
 nd general principles behind such techniques and explain why they are so i
 mportant to the NLP community. We will also explore problems that arise wh
 en extracting knowledge from multiple sentences and how that is closely re
 lated to concept mapping problems\, which are familiar to the semantic web
  community. Since fully automatic text mining is quite a difficult task\, 
 we will emphasize that semi-automatic approaches can be effective and viab
 le solutions for facilitating the RDFization of textual data.

DESCRIPTION:chair: Padmashree Ravindra\,Kemafor Anyanwu\nabstract: Cloud c
 omputing platforms such as Amazons EC2 and Hadoop have had significant a
 doption as large scale data processing platforms. Their attraction is the 
 possibility of fault-tolerant execution and elastic scaling up or down of 
 resources based on user requirements with minimal administrative burden to
  users. The rapid surge in volume of available RDF data has sharpened focu
 s on the issue of large scale processing of RDF\, making RDF query process
 ing in the cloud an important topic. RDF data processing in the cloud requ
 ires considerations about appropriate storage models and computing environ
 ments and the impact of their underlying assumptions on RDFs schema-last
  and join-intensive workloads. Some example considerations are the absence
  of indexes and statistics usually relied on by traditional query optimiza
 tion techniques and the heavy materialization in runtime execution environ
 ments such as Hadoop vs. pipelined execution plans used in traditional dat
 a processing systems. This tutorial will cover RDF query processing in the
  cloud\, particularly MapReduce execution platforms such as Hadoop. It wil
 l overview the basics of cloud computing and cloud data storage systems\, 
 optimization issues and the state-of-the-art in RDF query optimization for
  cloud systems. It will also discuss future directions and open issues in 
 query optimization for MapReduce environments.

DESCRIPTION:abstract: More and more semantic data are published following 
 the Linked Data principles\, that enable to set up links between objects i
 n different data sources\, by connecting information in a single global da
 ta space: the Web of Data. Today\, Web of Data includes different types of
  knowledge represented in a homogeneous form: sedimentary one (encyclopedi
 c\, cultural\, linguistic\, common-sense) and real-time one (news\, data s
 treams\, ...). This data might be useful to interlink diverse information 
 about users\, items\, and their relations and implement reasoning mechanis
 ms that can support and improve the recommendation process.  The challenge
  is to investigate whether and how this large amount of wide-coverage and 
 linked semantic knowledge can be automatically introduced into systems tha
 t perform tasks requiring human-level intelligence. Examples of such tasks
  include understanding a health problem in order to make a medical decisio
 n\, or simply deciding which laptop to buy. Recommender systems support us
 ers exactly in those complex tasks.  The primary goal of the workshop is t
 o showcase cutting edge research on the intersection of Semantic Technolog
 ies and Recommender Systems\, by taking the best of the two worlds. This c
 ombination may provide the Semantic Web community with important real-worl
 d scenarios where its potential can be effectively exploited into systems 
 performing complex tasks.

CATEGORY:WorkshopEvent
DESCRIPTION:abstract: The vision of the Multilingual Semantic Web workshop
  series is the creation of a Semantic Web where semantically structured in
 formation can be aligned\, integrated and used across languages. The works
 hops are concerned with research questions on how current Semantic Web inf
 rastructure can and should be extended to support this vision. Ontologies 
 and linked data vocabularies are defined often in one language only (Engli
 sh)\, with a biased semantics and a corresponding world view. An infrastru
 cture should be in place for defining ontologies and vocabularies in multi
 ple languages with a transparent semantics across them. Current Semantic W
 eb representation languages (RDF\, OWL\, SKOS) are limited in regard of th
 e representation of natural language semantics\, leaving much of the seman
 tics hidden in textual web content out of scope for the developing Web of 
 Data. NLP and machine learning for Linked Data can benefit from exploiting
  linguistic resources such as annotated corpora\, Wordnets etc. if they ar
 e themselves formally represented and linked by use of Linked Data princip
 les. In addressing such research questions\, the workshop aims at providin
 g a forum for researchers at the intersection of NLP\, multilingual inform
 ation access\, Linked Data and the Semantic Web to exchange ideas on reali
 zing the Multilingual Semantic Web.

DESCRIPTION:abstract: Most of the knowledge available on the Web is encode
 d in natural language texts or Web documents aimed primarily at human cons
 umption. A promising approach to have programmatic access to such knowledg
 e uses information extraction techniques that aim to extract machine reada
 ble structures from free texts\, from which it is possible to retrieve ent
 ities and categories. These entities can potentially be linked to each oth
 er\, creating de facto a global knowledge graph of linked entities. The Wo
 LE2012 workshop envisions the Web as a Web of Linked Entities (WoLE)\, whi
 ch transparently connects the World Wide Web (WWW) and the Giant Global Gr
 aph (GGG) using methods from Information Retrieval (IR) and Natural Langua
 ge Processing (NLP). The focus of this workshop is to bring together the I
 nformation Retrieval\, Semantic Web and NLP communities. The primary goal 
 is to strengthen research techniques that provide access to textual inform
 ation published on the Web to further improve the adoption of Semantic Web
  technology.

DESCRIPTION:chair: Volker Tresp\,Maximilian Nickel\nabstract: Machine lear
 ning has become increasingly important in the context of Linked Data as it
  is an enabling technology for many important tasks such as link predictio
 n\, information retrieval or group detection. The fundamental data structu
 re of Linked Data is a graph. Graphs are also ubiquitous in many other fie
 lds of application\, such as social networks\, bioinformatics or the World
  Wide Web. Recently\, tensor factorizations have emerged as a highly promi
 sing approach to machine learning on graph-structured data\, showing both 
 scalability and excellent results on benchmark data sets\, while matching 
 perfectly to the triple structure of RDF. This tutorial will provide an in
 troduction to tensor factorizations and their applications for machine lea
 rning on graphs. By the means of concrete tasks such as link prediction we
  will discuss several factorization methods in-depth and also provide nece
 ssary theoretical background on tensors in general. Emphasis is put on ten
 sor models that are of interest to Linked Data\, which will include models
  that are able to factorize large-scale graphs with millions of entities a
 nd known facts or models that can handle the open-world assumption of Link
 ed Data. Furthermore\, we will discuss tensor models for temporal and sequ
 ential graph data\, e.g. to analyze social networks over time.

DESCRIPTION:abstract: The wide availability of technologies such as GPS\, 
 map services and social networks has resulted in the proliferation of geos
 patial data on the Web. In addition to material produced by professionals 
 (e.g.\, maps)\, the public has also been encouraged to make geospatial con
 tent\, including their geographical location and a record of their outdoor
  activities\, available online. The volume of such user- generated geospat
 ial content is constantly growing. Similarly\, the amount of data extracte
 d from the Web and published as Linked Open Data is increasing. Linked Ope
 n Data include many data sets with geospatial properties such as coordinat
 es\, feature class or topological relations. The geo-referencing of Web re
 sources and users has given rise to various services and applications that
  exploit it. With the location of users being made available widely\, new 
 issues such as those pertaining to security and privacy arise. Likewise\, 
 emergency response\, context sensitive user applications\, and complex GIS
  tasks all lend themselves toward solutions that combine both the Geospati
 al Web and the Semantic Web. The workshop will bring together researchers 
 and practitioners from various disciplines\, as well as interested parties
  from industry and government\, to advance the frontiers of this exciting

DESCRIPTION:abstract: Scientific communication has traditionally relied up
 on publications and presentations\, with an estimate of millions of public
 ations worldwide per year\; the growth rate of PubMed alone is now 1 paper
  per minute. The results described in these articles are often backed by l
 arge amounts of diverse data produced by complex experiments\, computer si
 mulations\, and observations of physical phenomena. Because of this avalan
 che of data\, it is increasingly hard to validate\, reproduce\, reuse and 
 leverage scientific data. In addition\, although publications\, methods an
 d datasets are very related\, they are not easily accessible and interlink
 ed. The notable exception is omics research where journals require deposit
  of sequences in databanks as a condition of publication. Even where data 
 is discoverable and accessible\, significant challenges remain in data reu
 se and sharing\, in facilitating the necessary correlation\, integration a
 nd synthesis of data across levels of theory\, techniques and disciplines.
  In the 2nd International Workshop on Linked Science (LISC2012) we will di
 scuss and present results of new ways of publishing\, sharing and linking 
 scientific data together\, and reasoning over such data to discover intere
 sting new links to validate research. The theme of this years workshop w
 ill focus on research addressing these issues with respect to big data. Bi
 g Data is loosely characterized by the size and/or number of individual fi
 les\, the number of represented variables\, a range of physical scales\, a
  range of scientific disciplines\, heterogeneous metadata and data formats
 \, in short data that cannot easily be accessed and manipulated from a thu
 mb-drive.

CATEGORY:WorkshopEvent
DESCRIPTION:abstract: The quantity of published Linked Data is increasing 
 dramatically. However\, applications that consume Linked Data are not yet 
 widespread. Current approaches lack methods for seamless integration of Li
 nked Data from multiple sources\, dynamic discovery of available data and 
 data sources\, provenance and information quality assessment\, application
  development environments\, and appropriate end user interfaces. Addressin
 g these issues requires well-founded research\, including the development 
 and investigation of concepts that can be applied in systems which consume
  Linked Data from the Web. Following the success of the 1st and the 2nd In
 ternational Workshop on Consuming Linked Data\, we organize the third edit
 ion of this workshop in order to provide a platform for discussion and wor
 k on these open research problems. The main objective is to provide a venu
 e for scientific discourse  including systematic analysis and rigorous e
 valuation  of concepts\, algorithms and approaches for consuming Linked 
 Data.

 t Christophe\,Bernie Innocenti\nabstract: Linked Data have by-and-large be
 en designed around centralized\, powerful Web servers and the (mobile) cli
 ents accessing them. As a direct consequence of these design decisions\, t
 he usage of data- sharing technologies depends on the availability of a We
 b infrastructure comprised of data-centers\, high-speed\, reliable Interne
 t connections\, and modern client devices. Four-billion people currently h
 ave no access to such an infrastructure and are thus deprived of the benef
 its Linked (Open) Data provides. This tutorial will show how the design pr
 inciples and technologies of Linked Data can be adapted to distributed net
 works\, and thus contribute to closing this digital data divide. Join 
 us to learn how not to forget the majority of the world population when th
 inking of the potential users of Linked Data and discuss the challenges th
 is represents for the research community.

  for semantic technologies. Patterns for ontology engineering is a large p
 art\, but we also welcome reports on other kinds of knowledge and data pat
 terns\, design patterns for Semantic Web applications\, as well as best pr
 actices in general. Patterns need to be shared by a community in order to 
 provide a common language\, and to stimulate pattern usage and development

CATEGORY:WorkshopEvent
DESCRIPTION:abstract: One part of this workshop (LHD) is designed to bring
  together people from different fields working in the area of dynamic matc
 hing\, interpretation\, and integration of heterogeneous data\, so that id
 eas\, techniques and problems can be shared and discussed in a broad conte
 xt. A key part of this workshop is bringing together those from industry a
 nd government as well as those from academia. In order to interact success
 fully in an open and heterogeneous environment\, being able to dynamically
  and adaptively integrate data from other systems on the go is necessa
 ry. This may not be a precise process but a matter of finding a good enoug
 h understanding to allow interaction to proceed successfully. With the adv
 ent of the Web\, there are massive amounts of information available online
  that can assist in this task\, but this information is often chaotically 
 organised\, stored in a wide variety of data-formats\, and difficult to in
 terpret. The other part of this workshop (SemQuant) aims to unlock a new p
 aradigm in Semantic Web research\, and even in KR research in general\, by
  adding a quantitative research paradigm to the traditionally predominant 
 qualitative logic-based paradigm. This is motivated in part by the signifi
 cant growth in Semantic Web data\, including ontologies and Linked Data\, 
 over recent years. To efficiently manage the vast quantities of knowledge 
 and data on the Semantic Web\, we need theories and tools to address quest
 ions like: How can we measure knowledge? How are these measurements differ
 ent from measurements of information? How can we efficiently store knowled
 ge? How can we efficiently and accurately transform knowledge on noisy cha
 nnels like the Web? How can we measure the quality of ontologies and other
  forms of knowledge? How can we determine the quality of approximate metho
 ds for inference\, similarity\, soundness\, completeness\, etc.? How can s
 uch quantitative formalization help the engineering and realization of the
  Semantic Web?

 t: Provenance (the origin or source) of information is critical in decidin
 g whether information is to be trusted\, how it should be integrated with 
 other diverse information sources\, and how to give credit to its originat
 ors when reusing it. In order to promote the widespread publication of pro
 venance information on the Web\, the W3C is producing the W3C PROV set of 
 specifications. These specifications provide a basis for the common exchan
 ge of provenance information on the Web. This half- day tutorial provides 
 you with an indepth dive into these specifications including handson infor
 mation on how to publish\, query and access provenance information. You wi
 ll learn how to model your provenance data using the PROV data model and o
 ntology\, how to produce provenance information that enables integrity che
 cking and inferences\, as well as how to expose and acquire provenance inf
 ormation using PROV access mechanisms and services.

 cipation of the semantic web community in the recent surge of research on 
 the use of events as a key concept for representing knowledge and organisi
 ng and structuring media on the web. The workshop invites contributions to
  three central themes: event detection\, event representation\, and event 
 exploitation. Its goal is to formulate answers to questions in these theme
 s that advance and reflect the current state of understanding. Each submis
 sion will be expected to address at least two themes explicitly\, if possi
 ble including a system demonstration. This year\, we specifically invite c
 ontributions that address both event and conversation semantics in multime

DESCRIPTION:chair: Opher Etzion\,Nenad Stojanovic\,Ljiljana Stojanovic\,Fr
 ancoise Baude\nabstract: Processing of real-time data streams has become a
  very important mechanism in many application areas: Smart cities\, Smart 
 grid\, eHealth\, to name but a few. Although semantic technologies have be
 en recognized as one of very important enablers for this type of applicati
 ons\, there are still several challenges to be resolved in order to apply 
 them in real-world applications. Two most important challenges are: an exp
 ressive query language that enables the description of complex situations 
 to be detected (considering real-time and historical data) and an efficien
 t asynchronous retrieval mechanism for the large distributed data streams.
  Beside elaborating on the importance of these challenges for the real-tim
 e aware applications\, in this tutorial we give an overview of existing ap
 proaches for the semantic processing of real-time streams and present a no
 vel approach based on the recent development in two emerging research area
 s\, Complex Event Processing\, that enables an efficient in memory process
 ing of huge real-time data and Cloud Computing\, that supports an elastic 
 storage of enormous data volumes. Two studies will be demonstrated: We wil
 l show conceptual and technical details of the public-available Platform P
 LAY\, that realizes presented approach. We will demonstrate its usage thro
 ugh two applications that combine real-time events coming from Smartphone 
 (geo position\, incoming /outgoing /missing calls)\, Social media (Faceboo
 k wall updates and recent tweets) and real-time sensors. The approach for 
 writing semantic adapters for new event sources and semantic patterns to b
 e detected in event streams will be introduced.

DESCRIPTION:abstract: Workshop participants will discuss sketches of their
  papers with editors and eidtorial board members of the top Semantic Web j
 orunals as well as other workshop participants. The goal is to help attend
 ees to turn the sketches into successful submissions and avoid common stum
 bling blocks. People who wish to participate will be asked to submit a pap
 er sketch (see cfp). The accepted sketeches will be read by the editors an
 d the other chosen participants prior the workshop. Prior to the workshop\
 , participants whose sketches have been accepted to will receive one to th
 ree other sketches to read and review. During the workshop\, participants 
 will meet in small groups which includes an editorial board memeber. Durin
 g this discussion\, participants will receive specific feedback on on the 
 possible issues to address in order to turn the sketch into a possibly suc
 cessful submission. Selection for the Journal Workshop session is competit
 ive. Papers currently under review or revision are excluded.

DESCRIPTION:presenter: Tim Berners-Lee\,Mike Stonebreaker\,John Gianandrea
 \,Frank van Harmelen\,Bryan Thompson\nabstract: The Semantic Web / Linked 
 Data has grown immensely over the past years. When the Semantic Web commun
 ity started working over a decade ago the main question was where to get t
 he data from. By now the question of how to process ever increasing amount
  of semantic/linked data has come to people's utmost attention. The goal o
 f this panel is to shed light on the various approaches/options for Big Gr
 aph Data processing. Possible questions include: (1)Does the Semantic Web 
 need any central infrastructures? (It's a Web\, after all?) (2)Or will a h
 andful of large single-owner infrastructures dominate the Semantic Web\, j
 ust as they now dominate the current Web? (3)And if so\, will such infrast
 ructures be based on the standard relational model? (4)Or on MapReduce-cen
 tric key/value-pairs? (5)Is Google's (centralised) Knowledge Graph anathem
 a to the Semantic *Web* ? (6)Are triplestore vendors just reinventing the 
 old database wheels? (7)What is the role of clustered MapReduce-like solut
 ions and where are their limits for processing semantic web data?

DESCRIPTION:presenter: Mark A. Musen\nabstract: In the 1990s\, as the Worl
 d Wide Web became not only world wide but also dense and ubiquitous\, work
 ers in the artificial intelligence community were drawn to the possibility
  that the Web could provide the foundation for a new kind of AI.  Having s
 urvived the AI Winter of the 1980s\, the opportunities that they saw in th
 e largest\, most interconnected computing platform imaginable were obvious
 ly compelling.  With the subsequent success of the Semantic Web\, however\
 , our community seems to have stopped talking about many of the issues tha
 t researchers believe led to the AI Winter in the first place: the cogniti
 ve challenges in debugging and maintaining complex systems\, the drift in 
 the meanings ascribed to symbols\, the situated nature of knowledge\, the 
 fundamental difficulty of creating robust models.  These challenges are st
 ill with us\; we cannot wish them away with appeals to the open-world assu
 mption or to the law of large numbers.  Embracing these challenges will al
 low us to expand the scope of our science and our practice\, and will help
  to bring us closer to the ultimate vision of the Semantic Web.
