We assume that one cause of the latter is a lack of proper incentive structures of ontology projects. As a novel solution, we (1) propose to masquerade collaborative ontology engineering behind on-line, multi-player game scenarios, in order to create proper incentives for humans to help building ontologies for the Semantic Web.

We have enriched the knowledge base by means of text mining techniques, in order to discover on-topic relations. Several reasoning techniques have been applied, in order to infer relevant implicit relationships. Finally, the ontology and the knowledge base have been deployed on a semantic wiki by means of the WikiFactory tool, which allows users to browse the ontology and the knowledge base, to introduce new relations, to revise wrong assertions in a collaborative way, and to perform semantic queries.

Proceedings","In different areas ontologies have been developed and many of these ontologies contain overlapping information. Often we would therefore want to be able to use multiple ontologies. To obtain good results, we need to find the relationships between terms in the different ontologies, i.e. we need to align them. Currently, there already exist a number of different alignment strategies. However, it is usually difficult for a user that needs to align two ontologies to decide which of the different available strategies are the most suitable. In this paper we propose a method that provides recommendations on alignment strategies for a given alignment problem.  The method is based on the evaluation of the different available alignment strategies on several small selected pieces from the ontologies, and uses the evaluation results to provide recommendations. In the paper we give the basic steps of the method, and then illustrate and discuss the method in the setting of an alignment problem with two well-known biomedical ontologies. We also experiment with different implementations of the steps in the method.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,He Tan;Patrick Lambrix,2,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-76298-0_36,http://iswc2007.semanticweb.org/papers/491.pdf",2

Proceedings","This paper presents a semantic case-based reasoning framework for text categorization. Text categorization is the task of classifying text documents under predened categories. Accidentology is our application eld and the goal of our framework is to classify documents describing real road accidents under predened road accident prototpypes, which also are described by text documents. Accidents are described by accident reports while accident prototypes are described by accident scenarios. Thus, text categorization is done by assigning each accident report to an accident scenario, which highlights particular mechanisms leading to accident. We propose a textual case based reasoning approach (TCBR), which allows us to integrate both textual and domain knowledge aspects inorder to carry out this categorization. CBR solves a new problem (target case) by identifying its similarity to one or several previously solved problems (source cases) stored in a case base and by adapting their known solutions. Cases of our framework are created from text. Most of TCBR applications create cases from text by using Information Retrieval techniques, which leads to knowledge-poor descriptions of cases. We show that using semantic resources (two ontology of accidentology) makes possible to overcome this diculty, and allows us to enrich cases by using formal knowledge. In this paper, we argue that semantic resources are likely to improve the quality of cases created from text, and, therefore, such resources can support the reasoning cycle. We illustrate this claim with our framework developed to classify documents in the accidentology domain.",Semantic Web In Use Track Paper,,0,,0,Valentina Ceausu;Sylvie Desprès,2,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-76298-0_53,http://iswc2007.semanticweb.org/papers/729.pdf",2

In this paper we present AllRight, a comprehensive ontology instantiating system. In particular, the techniques implemented in AllRight are designed for application scenarios, in which the desired instance information is given in the form of tables and for which existing Information Extraction approaches based on statistical or natural language processing methods are not directly applicable. Within AllRight, we have therefore developed new techniques for dealing with tabular instance data and combined these techniques with existing methods. The system supports all necessary steps for ontology instantiation, i.e. web crawling, name extraction, document clustering as well as fact extraction and validation.

Proceedings","This paper deals with the problem of exploring hierarchical semantics from social annotations. Recently, social annotation services have become more and more popular in Semantic Web. It allows users to arbitrarily annotate web resources, thus, largely lowers the barrier to cooperation. Furthermore, through providing abundant meta-data resources, social annotation might become a key to the development of Semantic Web. However, on the other hand, social annotation has its own apparent limitations, for instance, 1) ambiguity and synonym phenomena and 2) lack of hierarchical information. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised model to automatically derive hierarchical semantics from social annotations. Using a social bookmark service Del.icio.us as example, we demonstrate that the derived hierarchical semantics has the ability to compensate those shortcomings. We further apply our model on another data set from Flickr to testify our model's applicability on different environments.

Proceedings","Many scientific problems can be represented as computational workflows of operations that access remote data, integrate heterogeneous data, and analyze and derive new data. Even when the data access and processing operations are implemented as web or grid services, workflows are often constructed manually in languages such as BPEL.  Adding semantic descriptions of the services enables automatic or mixed-initiative composition. In most previous work, these descriptions consists of semantic types for inputs and outputs of services or a type for the service as a whole. While this is certainly useful, we argue that is not enough to model and construct complex data workflows. We present a planning approach to automatically constructing data processing workflows where the inputs and outputs of services are relational descriptions in an expressive logic. Our workflow planner uses relational subsumption to connect the output of a service with the input of another. This modeling style has the advantage that adaptor services, so-called shims, can be automatically inserted into the workflow where necessary.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,José Luis Ambite;Dipsy Kapoor,2,"http://iswc2007.semanticweb.org/papers/015.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-76298-0_2",2

Therefore, it is important to establish interoperability between relational databases and ontologies for creating a Web of data.

In this paper, we propose a new approach to discovering simple mappings between a relational database schema and an ontology.

Proceedings","Data warehouse is now widely used in business analysis and decision making processes. To adapt the rapidly changing business environment, we develop a tool to make data warehouses more business-friendly by using Semantic Web technologies. The main idea is to make business semantics explicit by uniformly representing the business metadata (i.e. conceptual enterprise data model and multidimensional model) with an extended OWL language. Then a mapping from the business metadata to the schema of the data warehouse is built.  When an analysis request is raised, a customized data mart with data populated from the data warehouse can be automatically generated with the help of this built-in knowledge. This tool, called Enterprise Information Asset Workbench (EIAW), is deployed at the Taikang Life Insurance Company, one of the top five insurance companies of China. User feedback shows that OWL provides an excellent basis for the representation of business semantics in data warehouse, but many necessary extensions are also needed in the real application.

The intuitive idea is that similar interactions follow similar conventions and patterns, which can be analysed.

The suggestions can be evaluate by any standard ontology matcher: if they are accurate, the matchers avoid evaluating mappings unrelated to the interaction.

It can also serve as an ideal Semantic Web data source due to its abundance, influence, high quality and well-structuring. However, the heavy burden of up-building and maintaining such an enormous and ever-growing online encyclopedic knowledge base still rests on a very small group of people. Many casual users may still feel difficulties in writing high quality Wikipedia articles. In this paper, we use RDF graphs to model the key elements in Wikipedia authoring, and propose an integrated solution to make Wikipedia authoring easier based on RDF graph matching, expecting making more Wikipedians. Our solution facilitates semantics reuse and provides users with: 1) a link suggestion module that suggests and auto-completes internal links between Wikipedia articles for the user; 2) a category suggestion module that helps the user place her articles in correct categories. A prototype system is implemented and experimental results show significant improvements over existing solutions to link and category suggestion tasks.

Proceedings","The World Wide Web (WWW) now is widely used as a universal medium for information exchange. Semantic interoperability among different information systems in the WWW is limited due to information heterogeneity problem. Ontologies have been suggested as a way to solve this problem. Given that no universal ontology exists for the WWW, work has focused on finding semantic correspondences between similar elements of different ontologies, i.e., ontology mapping. Ontology mapping can be done either by hand or using automated tools. Manual mapping becomes impractical as the size and complexity of ontologies increases. Fully or semi-automated mapping approaches have been examined by different research studies, e.g., analyzing linguistic information of elements in ontologies, treating ontologies as structural graphs, applying heuristic rules to look for specific mapping patterns and machine learning techniques. This paper proposes a new generic and scalable ontology mapping approach, which takes advantage of propagation theory, information retrieval technique and artificial intelligence model to solve ontology mapping problem. The major procedures of the proposed approach are profile enrichment, profile propagation, IR-based profile mapping and the interactive activation network based constraints satisfaction. The profile enrichment builds a profile for each element in the ontologies, and thus enriches its information. The profile propagation exploits the neighboring information of each element by passing the profile of the ancestors, descendants or siblings of the element to the profile of itself, with different weights. The IR-based profile mapping process compares the cosine similarity of elementsâ profiles in a vector space model. Finally the interactive activation network is integrated to deal with the constraints satisfaction problems in the context of ontology mapping.",Doctoral Consortium Paper,,0,,0,Ming Mao,1,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-76298-0_72,http://iswc2007.semanticweb.org/papers/925.pdf",2

Proceedings","Extracting semantic relations is of great importance for the creation of the Semantic Web content. It is of great benefit to semi-automatically extract relations from the free text of Wikipedia using the structured content readily available in it. Pattern matching methods that employ information redundancy cannot work well since there is not much redundancy information in Wikipedia, compared to the Web. Multi-class classification methods are not reasonable since no classification of relation types is available in Wikipedia. In this paper, we propose PORE (Positive-Only Relation Extraction), for relation extraction from Wikipedia text. The core algorithm B-POL extends a state-of-the-art positive-only learning algorithm using bootstrapping, strong negative identification, and transductive inference to work with fewer positive training examples. We conducted experiments on several relations with different amount of training data. The experimental results show that B-POL can work effectively given only a small amount of positive training examples and it significantly outperforms the original positive learning approaches and a multi-class SVM. Furthermore, although PORE is applied in the context of Wikipedia, the core algorithm B-POL is a general approach for Ontology Population and can be adapted to other domains.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Yong Yu;Gang Wang;Haiping Zhu,3,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-76298-0_42,http://iswc2007.semanticweb.org/papers/575.pdf",2

This iterative process of integrating the data while constructing useful visualizations is desirable when the user is unfamiliar with the data at the beginning–a common case–and wishes to get immediate value out of the data without having to spend the overhead of completely and perfectly integrating the data first.

A prototype system named âSPARKâ has been implemented in light of this approach. Given a keyword query, SPARK outputs a ranked list of SPARQL queries as the translation result.

Proceedings","Several proposals have been put forward to support distributed agent cooperation in the Semantic Web, by allowing concepts and roles in one ontology be reused in another ontology. In general, these proposals reduce the autonomy of each ontology by defining the semantics of the ontology to depend on the semantics of the other ontologies. We propose a new framework for managing autonomy in a set of cooperating ontologies (or ontology space). In this framework, each language entity (concept/role/individual) in an ontology may have its meaning assigned either locally with respect to the semantics of its own ontology, to preserve the autonomy of the ontology, or globally with respect to the semantics of any neighbouring ontology in which it is defined, thus enabling semantic cooperation between multiple ontologies. In this way, each ontology has a ""subjective semantics"" based on local interpretation and a ""foreign semantics"" based on semantic binding to neighbouring ontologies.  We study the properties of these two semantics and describe the conditions under which entailment and satisfiability are preserved.  We also introduce two reasoning mechanisms under this framework: ""cautious reasoning"" and ""brave reasoning"". Cautious reasoning is done with respect to a local ontology and its neighbours (those ontologies in which its entities are defined); brave reasoning is done with respect to the transitive closure of this relationship. This framework is independent of ontology languages.

While structured queries can be used to find information more precisely on the Semantic Web, keyword searches are still needed to help exploit textual information.  It thus becomes very important that we can combine precise structured queries with imprecise keyword searches to have a hybrid query capability. In addition, due to the huge volume of information on the Semantic Web, the hybrid query must be processed in a very scalable way. In this paper, we define such a hybrid query capability that combines unary tree-shaped structured queries with keyword searches. We show how existing information retrieval (IR) index structures and functions can be reused to index semantic web data and its textual information, and how the hybrid query is evaluated on the index structure using IR engines in an efficient and scalable manner. We implemented this IR approach in an engine called Semplore. Comprehensive experiments on its performance show that it is a promising approach.

We close the paper with a demonstration of the usefulness of our iSPARQL framework in the context of a data integration and an ontology mapping experiment.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Abraham Bernstein;Christoph Kiefer;Markus Stocker,3,"http://iswc2007.semanticweb.org/papers/295.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-76298-0_22",2

Proceedings","For the development of Semantic Web technology, researchers and developers in the Semantic Web community need to focus on the areas in which human reasoning is particularly difficult. Two studies in this paper demonstrate that people are predisposed to use class-inclusion labels for inductive judgments. This tendency appears to stem from a general characteristic of human reasoning â using heuristics to solve problems. The inference engines and interface designs that incorporate human reasoning need to integrate this general characteristic underlying human induction.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Takashi Yamauchi,1,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-76298-0_44,http://iswc2007.semanticweb.org/papers/603.pdf",2

Proceedings","Governments often hold very rich data and whilst much of this information is published and available for re-use by others, it is often trapped by poor data structures, locked up in legacy data formats or in fragmented databases. One of the great benefits that Semantic Web (SW) technology offers is facilitating the large scale integration and sharing of distributed data sources. At the heart of information policy in the UK, the Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI) is the part of the UK government charged with enabling the greater re-use of public sector information. This paper describes the actions, findings, and lessons learnt from a pilot study, involving several parts of government and the public sector. The aim was to show to government how they can adopt SW technology for the dissemination, sharing and use of its data.",Semantic Web In Use Track Paper,,0,,0,Kieron O'Hara;Nigel Shadbolt;John Sheridan;David Dupplaw;Harith Alani;John Darlington;Carol Tullo,7,"http://iswc2007.semanticweb.org/papers/701.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-76298-0_51",2

Proceedings","This paper presents a tableau approach for deciding description logics outside the scope of OWL DL and current state-of-the-art tableau-based description logic systems.  In particular, we define a sound and complete tableau calculus for the description logic ALBO and show that it provides a basis for decision procedures for this logic and numerous other description logics with full role negation. ALBO is the extension of ALC with the Boolean role operators, inverse of roles, domain and range restriction operators and it includes full support for objects (nominals).  ALBO is a very expressive description logic which is NExpTime complete and subsumes Boolean modal logic and the two-variable fragment of first-order logic.  An important novelty is the use of a versatile, unrestricted blocking rule as a replacement for standard loop checking mechanisms implemented in description logic systems. An implementation of our approach exists in the MetTeL system.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Renate A.

Proceedings","In this paper, we present a new approach to web search personalization based on user collaboration and sharing of information about web documents. The proposed personalization technique separates data collection and user profiling from the information system whose contents and indexed documents are being searched for, i.e. the search engines, and uses social bookmarking and tagging to re-rank web search results. It is independent of the search engine being used, so users are free to choose the one they prefer, even if their favorite search engine does not natively support personalization. We show how to design and implement such a system in practice and investigate its feasibility and usefulness with large sets of real-word data and a user study.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Michael G.

Proceedings","Automatic knowledge reuse for Semantic Web applications imposes several challenges on ontology search. Existing ontology retrieval systems merely return a lengthy list of relevant single ontologies, which may not completely cover the specified user requirements. Therefore, there arises an increasing demand for a tool or algorithm with a mechanism to check concept adequacy of existing ontologies with respect to a user query, and then recommend a single or combination of ontologies which can entirely fulfill the requirements. Thus, this paper develops an algorithm, namely combiSQORE to determine whether the available collection of ontologies is able to completely satisfy a submitted query and return a single or combinative ontology that guarantees query coverage. In addition, it ranks the returned answers based on their conceptual closeness and query coverage. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is simple, efficient and effective.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Rachanee Ungrangsi;Vilas Wuwongse;Chutiporn Anutariya,3,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-76298-0_41,http://iswc2007.semanticweb.org/papers/561.pdf",2
