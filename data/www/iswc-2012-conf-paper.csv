The graph enhances Google search in three main ways: by disambiguation of search queries, by search log-based summarization of key facts, and by explorative search suggestions. With this paper, we suggest a fourth way of enhancing Web search: through the addition of realtime coverage of what people say about real-world entities on social networks. We report on a browser extension that seamlessly adds relevant microposts from the social networking sites Google+, Facebook, and Twitter in form of a panel to Knowledge Graph entities.

Quest supports commercial and open source databases, including database federation tools like Teiid to allow for Ontology Based Data Integration of relational and other sources (e.g., CSV, Excel, XML).

The system is designed to support a peer-review mechanism for creating new names, and uses a controlled vocabulary encoded in the Web Ontology Language to represent the observational features. A prototype of the system is currently under development in collaboration with the Mushroom Observer website. It allows users to propose new names and descriptions, provide feedback on those proposals, and ultimately have them formally approved.

To enforce interoperability at runtime and in a non-intrusive manner, mediators are used to perform the necessary translations and coordination between the heterogeneous applications.

A subtask for Linked Data interfaces is to present entities and their properties in a concise form. In general, these summaries take individual attributes and sometimes user contexts and preferences into account. But the objective evaluation of the quality of such summaries is an expensive task.

As semantic search becomes mainstream, there is growing need for standardised, comprehensive evaluation frameworks. In this study, we assess the usability and user satisfaction of different semantic search query input approaches (natural language and view-based) from the perspective of different user types (experts and casuals). Contrary to previous studies, we found that casual users preferred the form-based query approach whereas expert users found the graph-based to be the most intuitive.

QuID is a reasoner for OWL 2 QL that is based on the system Quonto and is able to deal with inconsistent ontologies. The central aspect of QuID is that it implements two different, orthogonal strategies for dealing with inconsistency: ABox repairing techniques, based on data manipulation, and consistent query answering techniques, based on query rewriting. Moreover, by exploiting the ability of Quonto to delegate the management of the ABox to a relational database system (DBMS), such techniques are potentially able to handle very large inconsistent ABoxes. For the above reasons, QuID allows for experimentally comparing the above two different strategies for inconsistency handling in the context of OWL 2 QL. We thus report on the experimental evaluation that we have conducted using QuID. Our results clearly point out that inconsistency-tolerance in OWL 2 QL ontologies is feasible in practical cases.

In order to facilitate data utilization in the Semantic Web, without compromising the freedom of people to publish their data, one critical problem is to appropriately interlink such heterogeneous data. This interlinking process can also be referred to as Entity Coreference, i.e., finding which identifiers refer to the same real world entity. This proposal will investigate algorithms to solve this entity coreference problem in the Semantic Web in several aspects. The essence of entity coreference is to compute the similarity of instance pairs. Given the diversity of domains of existing datasets, it is important that an entity coreference algorithm be able to achieve good precision and recall across domains represented in various ways. Furthermore, in order to scale to large datasets, an algorithm should be able to intelligently select what information to utilize for comparison and determine whether to compare a pair of instances to reduce the overall complexity.

In this paper we show how we can exploit blank nodes anonymity in order to reduce the delta (diff) size when comparing such KBs.

However, the widely-used time-decay-based approach worsens the sparsity problem because it deemphasizes old item transactions. We introduce two ideas to solve the sparsity problem. First, we divide the users' transactions into epochs i.e. time periods, and identify epochs that are dominated by interests similar to the current interests of the active user. Thus, it can eliminate dissimilar transactions while making use of similar transactions that exist in prior epochs. Second, we use a taxonomy of items to model user item transactions in each epoch. This well captures the interests of users in each epoch even if there are few transactions. It suits the situations in which the items transacted by users dynamically change over time; the semantics behind classes do not change so often while individual items often appear and disappear. Fortunately, many taxonomies are now available on the web because of the spread of the Linked Open Data vision. We can now use those to understand dynamic user interests semantically. We evaluate our method using a dataset, a music listening history, extracted from users' tweets and one containing a restaurant visit history gathered from a gourmet guide site.

First, it is often quite difficult to even determine which concepts have had their meaning altered by a change. Second, once a concept change is pinpointed, the problem of distinguishing whether the concept is directly or indirectly affected by a change has yet to be tackled. To address the first issue, various principled notions of ``semantic diff'' (based on deductive inseparability) have been proposed in the literature and shown to be computationally practical for the expressively restricted case of ELHr-terminologies. However, problems arise even for such limited logics as ALC: First, computation gets more difficult, becoming undecidable for logics such as SROIQ which underly the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Second, the presence of negation and disjunction make the standard semantic difference too sensitive to change: essentially, any logically effectual change always affects all terms in the ontology. In order to tackle these issues, we formulate the central notion of finding the minimal change set based on model inseparability, and present a method to differentiate changes which are specific to (thus directly affect) particular concept names.

We propose the use of state-of-the art locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) techniques to vastly improve the scalability of instance matching across multiple types. We show the feasibility of our approach with DBpedia and Freebase, two different type systems with hundreds and thousands of types, respectively. We describe how these techniques can be used to estimate containment or equivalence relations between two type systems, and we compare two different LSH techniques for computing instance similarity.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Anastasios Kementsietsidis;Kavitha Srinivas;Achille Fokoue;Songyun Duan;Oktie Hassanzadeh;Michael J.

This class of solutions promises both to facilitate the integration of research data with other relevant sources of information and also to support more intelligent forms of querying and exploration. However, an issue which has only been partially addressed is that of generating and characterizing semantically the relations that exist between research areas. This problem has been traditionally addressed by manually creating taxonomies, such as the ACM classification of research topics. However, this manual approach is inadequate for a number of reasons: these taxonomies are very coarse-grained and they do not cater for the finegrained research topics, which define the level at which typically researchers (and even more so, PhD students) operate. Moreover, they evolve slowly, and therefore they tend not to cover the most recent research trends. In addition, as we move towards a semantic characterization of these relations, there is arguably a need for a more sophisticated characterization than a homogeneous taxonomy, to reflect the different ways in which research areas can be related. In this paper we propose Klink, a new approach to i) automatically generating relations between research areas and ii) populating a bibliographic ontology, which combines both machine learning methods and external knowledge, which is drawn from a number of resources, including Google Scholar and Wikipedia.

Even very experienced modellers with a sophisticated grasp of reasoning algorithms do not have a good mental model of reasoner performance behaviour. Seemingly innocuous changes to an OWL ontology can degrade classification time from instantaneous to too long to wait for. Similarly, switching reasoners (e.g., to take advantage of specific features) can result in wildly different classification times. In this paper we investigate performance variability phenomena in OWL ontologies, and present methods to identify subsets of an ontology which are performance-degrading for a given reasoner. When such (ideally small) subsets are removed from an ontology, and the remainder is much easier for the given reasoner to reason over, we designate them âhot spotsâ?. The identification of these hot spots allows users to isolate difficult portions of the ontology in a principled and systematic way. Moreover, we devise and compare various methods for approximate reasoning and knowledge compilation based on hot spots. We verify our techniques with a select set of varyingly difficult ontologies from the NCBO BioPortal, and were able to, firstly, successfully identify performance hot spots against the major freely available DL reasoners, and, secondly, significantly improve classification time using approximate reasoning based on hot spots.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Bijan Parsia;Rafael S.

Finally, our work is complemented with a functional evaluation on three representative strRS engines: SPARQLStream, C-SPARQL and CQELS. The presented results are meant to give a first baseline and illustrate the state-of-the-art.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Ying Zhang;Minh-Duc Pham 0001;Jean-Paul Calbimonte;Óscar Corcho,4,"http://iswc2012.semanticweb.org/sites/default/files/76490625.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-35176-1_40",2

Hence, there is a need for combined geo-thematic logics that provide a sufficiently expressive query language allowing for FOL rewritability. The DL-Lite family of description logics is tailored towards FOL rewritability of query answering for unions of conjunctive queries, hence it is a suitable candidate for the thematic component of a combined geo-thematic logic. We show that a weak coupling of DL-Lite with the expressive region connection calculus RCC8 allows for FOL rewritability under a spatial completeness condition for the ABox. Stronger couplings allowing for FOL rewritability are possible only for spatial calculi as weak as the low-resolution calculus RCC2. Already a strong combination of DL-Lite with the low-resolution calculus RCC3 does not allow for FOL rewritability.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Özgür Lütfü Özçep;Ralf Möller,2,"http://iswc2012.semanticweb.org/sites/default/files/76490641.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-35176-1_41",2

Automatic annotation is not of sufficient quality to enable focused search and retrieval: either too many or too few terms are semantically annotated. User-defined semantic enrichment allows for a more targeted approach. We developed a tool for semantic annotation of digital documents and conducted an end-user study to evaluate its acceptance by and usability for non-expert users. This paper presents the results of this user study and discusses the lessons learned about both the semantic enrichment process and our methodology of exposing non-experts to semantic enrichment.,Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Ralf Heese;Adrian Paschke;Annika Hinze;Markus Luczak-Rösch,4,"http://iswc2012.semanticweb.org/sites/default/files/76490161.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-35176-1_11",2

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach of adding semantics as additional features into the training set for sentiment analysis. For each extracted entity (e.g. iPhone) from tweets, we add its semantic concept (e.g. ''Apple product'') as an additional feature, and measure the correlation of the representative concept with negative/positive sentiment. We apply this approach to predict sentiment for three different Twitter datasets. Our results show an average increase of F harmonic accuracy score for identifying both negative and positive sentiment of around 6.5% and 4.8% over the baselines of unigrams and part-of-speech features respectively. We also compare against an approach based on sentiment-bearing topic analysis, and find that semantic features produce better Recall and F score when classifying negative sentiment, and better Precision with lower Recall and F score in positive sentiment classification.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Hassan Saif;Harith Alani;Yulan He,3,"http://iswc2012.semanticweb.org/sites/default/files/76490497.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-35176-1_32",2

Like GeoSPARQL, these new versions use OGC standards to represent geometries where the original versions used linear constraints.

To this end, the W3C standard provides a simple system of deduction rules, which operate directly on the RDF syntax of OWL. Several similar systems have been studied. However, these approaches are usually complete for instance retrieval only. This paper asks if and how such methods could also be used for computing entailed subclass relationships. Checking entailment for arbitrary OWL RL class subsumptions is co-NP-hard, but tractable rule-based reasoning is possible when restricting to subsumptions between atomic classes. Surprisingly, however, this cannot be achieved in any RDF-based rule system, i.e., the W3C calculus cannot be extended to compute all atomic class subsumptions. We identify syntactic restrictions to mitigate this problem, and propose a rule system that is sound and complete for many OWL RL ontologies.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Markus Krötzsch,1,"http://iswc2012.semanticweb.org/sites/default/files/76490273.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-35176-1_18",2

Despite the rise in popularity of Attention-Information Networks (i.e. microblogging platforms) and the production of content within such platforms, no existing work has attempted to exploit the semantics of published content when predicting network links. In this paper we present an approach that fills this gap by a) predicting follower edges within a directed social network by exploiting concept graphs and thereby significantly outperforming a random baseline and models that rely solely on network topology information, and b) assessing the different behavior that users exhibit when making followee-addition decisions. This latter contribution exposes latent factors within social networks and the existence of a clear need for topical affinity between users for a follow link to be created.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Milan Stankovic;Harith Alani;Matthew Rowe,3,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-35176-1_30,http://iswc2012.semanticweb.org/sites/default/files/76490465.pdf",2
