Drawing upon Wikipedia's model of massive user collaboration, WikiEarth's motivation is to extend beyond this by formalizing the relationships between the data being entered. A semantic ontology is a natural candidate for data representation for three reasons: first, the hierarchical class structure of an OWL-Ontology helps avoid redundancy when developing simulations, as an operation can be applied to a class and all its subclasses; secondly, a framework like Jena helps eliminate human error and reduce the amount of data entry that needs to be performed; and finally, important restrictions regarding data entry are imposed by the ontological structure and Jena, as opposed to by a proprietary system developed for one specific application. Utilizing this infrastructure, a WikiEarth Climate Demonstration was successfully conceptualized, constructed, deployed and subsequently unveiled at the 2009 World Student Environmental Summit. The success of this application demonstrates that ontologies could be effectively purposed for a high-traffic production system.",Poster/Demo Paper,,0,,0,Christian Battista;Benjamin Coe,2,https://github.com/lidingpku/iswc-archive/raw/master/paper/iswc-2009-poster/133/paper133.pdf,1

Since web services can be enhanced with formal semantic descriptions, forming the ""semantic web services"", it becomes conceivable to exploit the quality of semantic links between services (of any composition) as one of the optimization criteria. For this we propose to use the semantic similarities between output and input parameters of web services. Coupling this with other criteria such as quality of service (QoS) allow us to rank and optimize compositions achieving the same goal. We present the Composition Optimizer tool, using an innovative and extensible optimization model designed to balance semantic fit (or functional quality) with non-functional QoS metrics, in order to optimize service composition.

Events, simple or complex, are models for things that happen e.g., when a user interacts with a Web page. Events are consumed in some meaningful way e.g., for monitoring reasons or to trigger actions such as responses. In order for receiving parties to understand events e.g., comprehend what has led to an event, we propose a general event schema using RDFS. In this schema we cover the composition of complex events and event-to-event relationships. These events can then be used to route semantic information about an occurrence to different recipients helping in making the Semantic Web active. Additionally, we present an architecture for detecting and composing events in Web clients. For the contents of events we show a way of how they are enriched with semantic information about the context in which they occurred. The paper is presented in conjunction with the use case of Semantic Advertising, which extends traditional clickstream analysis by introducing semantic short-term profiling, enabling discovery of the current interest of a Web user and therefore supporting advertisement providers in responding with more relevant advertisements.",Semantic Web In Use Track Paper,,0,,0,Nenad Stojanovic;Sinan Sen;Roland Stuhmer;Kay-Uwe Schmidt;Darko Anicic;Jun Ma,6,,0

They often provide a large amount of category definitions and some sort of hierarchies.

Unfortunately, classifications can mostly not be directly used as ontologies in OWL, because they are not (or at least: very bad) ontologies. In particular, the labels in categories often lack a context-neutral notion of what it means to be an instance of that category, and the meaning of the hierarchical relations is often not a strict subClassOf. SKOS2OWL is an online tool that allows deriving consistent RDF-S or OWL ontologies from most hierarchical classifications available in the W3C SKOS exchange format. SKOS2OWL helps the user narrow down the intended meaning of the available categories to classes and guides the user through several modeling choices. In particular, SKOS2OWL can draw a representative random sample of relevant conceptual elements in the SKOS file and asks the user to make statements about their meaning.

Moreover, SPoX reacts to arbitrary events in Skype's Social Network as well, such as on-line status changes of users or the birthday of a friend. The decisions about how SPoX reacts are defined by means of Semantic Web policies that do not only consider the context of the user (such as time or on-line status) but include Social Semantic Web data into the policy reasoning process. By this means, users can state that, for instance, only people defined as friends in their FOAF profile, only friends on Twitter, or even only people they wrote a paper with are allowed to call. Further, SPoX exploits Semantic Web techniques for advanced negotiations by means of exchanging policies over the Skype application channel.

While in many cases, just presenting the justification is sufficient for user understanding, and in all cases justifications are much better than nothing, we have empirically identified cases where understanding how a justification supports an entailment is inordinately difficult. Indeed there are naturally occurring justifications that people, with varying expertise in OWL, cannot understand. To address this problem, we have developed a novel conceptual framework for justification oriented proofs. Given a justification for an entailment in an ontology, intermediate inference steps, called lemmas, are automatically derived, that bridge the gap between the axioms in the justification and the entailment. The proof shows in a stepwise way how the lemmas and ultimately the entailment follow from the justification. At the heart of the framework is the notion of a ``complexity model'', which predicts how easy or difficult it is for a user to understand a justification, and is used for selecting the lemmas to insert into a proof.

There are many matching systems that generate mappings between different ontologies either automatically or semi-automatically. However, the mappings generated by these systems may be inconsistent with the ontologies. Several approaches have been proposed to deal with the inconsistencies between mappings and ontologies. This problem is often called a mapping revision problem, as the ontologies are assumed to be correct, whereas the mappings are repaired when resolving the inconsistencies. In this paper, we first propose a conflict-based mapping revision operator and show that it can be characterized by two logical postulates adapted from some existing postulates for belief base revision. We then provide an algorithm for iterative mapping revision by using an ontology revision operator and show that this algorithm defines a conflict-based mapping revision operator. Three concrete ontology revision operators are given to instantiate the iterative algorithm, which result in three different mapping revision algorithms.

Towards tackling the scalability problem, we propose a decomposition-based approach to optimizing existing OWL DL reasoners in evaluating conjunctive queries in OWL DL ontologies. The main idea is to decompose a given OWL DL ontology into a set of target ontologies without duplicated ABox axioms so that the evaluation of a given conjunctive query can be separately performed in every target ontology by applying existing OWL DL reasoners. This approach guarantees sound and complete results for the category of conjunctive queries that the applied OWL DL reasoner correctly evaluates.

Proceedings","The framework developed in this paper can deal with scenarios where selected sub-ontologies of a large ontology are offered as views to users, based on criteria like the user's access right, the trust level required by the application, or the level of detail requested by the user. Instead of materializing a large number of different sub-ontologies, we propose to keep just one ontology, but equip each axiom with a label from an appropriate labeling lattice. The access right, required trust level, etc. is then also represented by a label (called user label) from this lattice, and the corresponding sub-ontology is determined by comparing this label with the axiom labels. For large-scale ontologies, certain consequence (like the concept hierarchy) are often precomputed. Instead of precomputing these consequences for every possible sub-ontology, our approach computes just one label for each consequence such that a comparison of the user label with the consequence label determines whether the consequence follows from the corresponding sub-ontology or not. In this paper we determine under which restrictions on the user and axiom labels such consequence labels (called boundaries) always exist, describe different black-box approaches for computing boundaries, and present first experimental results that compare the efficiency of these approaches on large real-world ontologies. Black-box means that, rather than requiring modifications of existing reasoning procedures, these approaches can use such procedures directly as sub-procedures, which allows us to employ existing highly-optimized reasoners.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Martin Knechtel;Rafael Peñaloza;Franz Baader,3,"http://data.semanticweb.org/pdfs/iswc/2009/paper286.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-04930-9_4",2

Since powerful broker nodes are not always available (due to lack of long range connectivity), create a bottleneck (since mobile devices are all trying to access the same server) and single point of failure (in the case that a central server fails), on-board mobile reasoning must be supported.

Proceedings","Ontology matching plays a key role for semantic interoperability. Many methods have been proposed for automatically finding the alignment between heterogeneous ontologies. However, in many real-world applications, finding the alignment in a completely automatic way is highly infeasible. Ideally, an ontology matching system would have an interactive interface to allow users to provide feedbacks to guide the automatic algorithm. Fundamentally, we need answer the following questions: how can a system perform an efficiently interactive process with the user? How many interactions are sufficient for finding a more accurate matching? To address these questions, we propose an active learning framework for ontology matching, which tries to find the most informative candidate matches to query the user. The user's feedbacks are used to: 1) correct the mistake matching and 2) propagate the supervise information to help the entire matching process. Three measures are proposed to estimate the confidence of each matching candidate. A correct propagation algorithm is further proposed to maximize the spread of the user's guidance"". Experimental results on several public data sets show that the proposed approach can significantly improve the matching accuracy (+8.0% better than the baseline methods).""",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Juanzi Li;Guoton Xie;Feng Shi;Hanyu Li;Jie Tang,5,"http://data.semanticweb.org/pdfs/iswc/2009/paper206.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-04930-9_37",2

Proceedings","Forgetting is an important tool for reducing ontologies by eliminating some concepts and roles while preserving sound and complete reasoning. Attempts have previously been made to address the problem of forgetting in relatively simple description logics (DLs) such as DL-Lite and extended EL. The ontologies used in these attempts were mostly restricted to TBoxes rather than general knowledge bases (KBs). However, the issue of forgetting for general KBs in more expressive description logics, such as ALC and OWL DL, is largely unexplored. In particular, the problem of characterizing and computing forgetting for such logics is still open. In this paper, we first define semantic forgetting about concepts and roles in ALC ontologies and state several important properties of forgetting in this setting. We then define the result of forgetting for concept descriptions in ALC, state the properties of forgetting for concept descriptions, and present algorithms for computing the result of forgetting for concept descriptions. Unlike the case of DL-Lite, the result of forgetting for an ALC ontology does not exist in general, even for the special case of concept forgetting. This makes the problem of how to compute forgetting in ALC more challenging. We address this problem by defining a series of approximations to the result of forgetting for ALC ontologies and studying their properties and their application to reasoning tasks. We use the algorithms for computing forgetting for concept descriptions to compute these approximations. Our algorithms for computing approximations can be embedded into an ontology editor to enhance its ability to manage and reason in (large) ontologies.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Jeff Z.

Proceedings","RDF is an increasingly important paradigm for the representation of information on the Web. As RDF databases increase in size to approach tens of millions of triples, and as sophisticated graph matching queries expressible in languages like SPARQL become increasingly important, scalability becomes an issue. To date, there is no graph-based indexing method for RDF data where the index was designed in a way that makes it disk-resident. There is therefore a growing need for indexes that can operate efficiently when the index itself resides on disk. In this paper, we first propose the DOGMA index for fast subgraph matching on disk and then develop a basic algorithm to answer queries over this index. This algorithm is then significantly sped up via an optimized algorithm that uses efficient (but correct) pruning strategies when combined with two different extensions of the index. We have implemented a preliminary system and tested it against four existing RDF database systems developed by others.

SPARQL has become recently a W3C standard for querying RDF data, but it mostly provides means for querying simple RDF graphs only, whereas querying with respect to RDFS or other entailment regimes is left outside the current specification. In this paper, we show that SPARQL faces certain unwanted ramifications when querying ontologies in conjunction with RDF datasets that comprise multiple named graphs, and we provide an extension for SPARQL that remedies these effects. Moreover, since RDFS inference has a close relationship with logic rules, we generalize our approach to select a custom ruleset for specifying inferences to be taken into account in a SPARQL query. We show that our extensions are technically feasible by providing benchmark results for RDFS querying in our prototype system GiaBATA, which uses Datalog coupled with a persistent Relational Database as a back-end for implementing SPARQL with dynamic rule-based inference.

In this paper we present an approach to execute SPARQL queries over the Web of Linked Data. The main idea of our approach is to discover data that might be relevant for answering a query during the query execution itself. This discovery is driven by following RDF links between data sources based on URIs in the query and in partial results. The URIs are resolved over the HTTP protocol into RDF data which is continuously added to the queried dataset. This paper describes concepts and algorithms to implement our approach using an iterator-based pipeline.

Proceedings","State-of-the-art discovery of Semantic Web services is based on hybrid algorithms that combine semantic and syntactic matchmaking. These approaches are purely based on similarity measures between parameters of a service request and available service descriptions, which, however, fail to completely capture the actual functionality of the service or the quality of the results returned by it. On the other hand, with the advent of Web 2.0, active user participation and collaboration has become an increasingly popular trend. Users often rate or group relevant items, thus providing valuable information that can be taken into account to further improve the accuracy of search results. In this paper, we tackle this issue, by proposing a method that combines multiple matching criteria with user feedback to further improve the results of the matchmaker. We extend a previously proposed dominance-based approach for service discovery, and describe how user feedback is incorporated in the matchmaking process.

Proceedings","RDF data are usually accessed using one of two methods: either, graphs are rendered in forms perceivable by human users (e.g., in tabular or in graphical form), which are difficult to handle for large data sets. Alternatively, query languages like SPARQL provide means to express information needs in structured form; hence they are targeted towards developers and experts. Inspired by the concept of spreadsheet tools, where users can perform relatively complex calculations by splitting formulas and values across multiple cells, we have investigated mechanisms that allow us to access RDF graphs in a more intuitive and manageable, yet formally grounded manner. In this paper, we make three contributions towards this direction. First, we present RDFunctions, an algebra that consists of mappings between sets of RDF language elements (URIs, blank nodes, and literals) under consideration of the triples contained in a background graph. Second, we define a syntax for expressing RDFunctions, which can be edited, parsed and evaluated. Third, we discuss Tripcel, an implementation of RDFunctions using a spreadsheet metaphor. Using this tool, users can easily edit and execute function expressions and perform analysis tasks on the data stored in an RDF graph.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Bernhard Schandl,1,"http://data.semanticweb.org/pdfs/iswc/2009/paper347.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-04930-9_34",2

Proceedings","Module extraction methods have proved to be effective in improving the performance of some ontology reasoning tasks, including finding justifications to explain why an entailment holds in an OWL DL ontology. However, the existing module extraction methods that compute a syntactic locality-based module for the sub-concept in a subsumption entailment, though ensuring the resulting module to preserve all justifications of the entailment, may be insufficient in improving the performance of finding all justifications. This is because a syntactic locality-based module is independent of the super-concept in a subsumption entailment and always contains all concept/role assertions. In order to extract smaller modules to further optimize finding all justifications in an OWL DL ontology, we propose a goal-directed method for extracting a module that preserves all justifications of a given entailment. Experimental results on large ontologies show that a module extracted by our method is smaller than the corresponding syntactic locality-based module, making the subsequent computation of all justifications more scalable and more efficient.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Guilin Qi;Qiu Ji;Jianfeng Du,3,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-04930-9_11,http://data.semanticweb.org/pdfs/iswc/2009/paper251.pdf",2

Proceedings","Ontologies are tools for describing and structuring knowledge, with many applications in searching and analyzing complex knowledge bases. Since building them manually is a costly process, there are various approaches for bootstrapping ontologies automatically through the analysis of appropriate documents. Such an analysis needs to find the concepts and the relationships that should form the ontology. However, since relationship extraction methods are imprecise and cannot homogeneously cover all concepts, the initial set of relationships is usually inconsistent and rather imbalanced - a problem which, to the best of our knowledge, was mostly ignored so far. In this paper, we define the problem of extracting a consistent as well as properly structured ontology from a set of inconsistent and heterogeneous relationships. Moreover, we propose and compare three graph-based methods for solving the ontology extraction problem. We extract relationships from a large-scale data set of more than 325K documents and evaluate our methods against a gold standard ontology comprising more than 12K relationships.

In this paper we study what we perceive as the semantic gap between the supply of data on the Semantic Web and the needs of web users as expressed in the queries submitted to a major Web search engine.

Proceedings","In this paper, we consider the problem of materializing the complete finite RDFS closure in a scalable manner; this includes those parts of the RDFS closure that are often ignored such as literal generalization and container membership properties. We point out characteristics of RDFS that allow us to derive an embarrassingly parallel algorithm for producing said closure, and we evaluate our C/MPI implementation of the algorithm on a cluster with 128 cores using different-size subsets of the LUBM 10,000-university data set. We show that the time to produce inferences scales linearly with the number of processes, evaluating this behavior on up to hundreds of millions of triples. We also show the number of inferences produced for different subsets of LUBM10k. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to provide RDFS inferencing on such large data sets in such low times. Finally, we discuss future work in terms of promising applications of this approach including OWL2RL rules, MapReduce implementations, and massive scaling on supercomputers.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,James Hendler;Jesse Weaver,2,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-04930-9_43,http://data.semanticweb.org/pdfs/iswc/2009/paper241.pdf",2

Such information from several Web pages can be very easily aggregated, mashed up and presented in other Web pages. Content generation of this nature inevitably leads to many copyright and license violations, motivating research into effective methods to detect and prevent such violations. This is supported by an experiment on Creative Commons (CC) attribution license violations from samples of Web sites that had at least one embedded Flickr image, which revealed that the attribution license violation rate of Flickr images on the Web is around 70-90%. Our primary objective is to enable users to do the right thing and comply with CC licenses associated with Web media, instead of preventing them from doing the wrong thing or detecting violations of these licenses. As a solution, we have implemented two applications: (1) Attribution License Violations Validator, which can be used to validate users' derived work against attribution licenses of reused media and, (2) Semantic Clipboard, which provides license awareness of Web media and enables users to copy them along with the appropriate license metadata.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Lalana Kagal;Oshani Seneviratne;Tim Berners-Lee,3,"http://data.semanticweb.org/pdfs/iswc/2009/paper375.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-04930-9_35",2

A second approach is to take advantage of the great deal of structured information already present in various databases, and to develop common ontologies, publishing standards, and reward systems to make this data widely accessible. We consider here a third approach: developing software that automatically extracts structured information from unstructured text present on the web. This talk will survey attempts to extract structured knowledge from unstructured text, and will focus on an approach with three characteristics that we hypothesize make it viable. First, in contrast to the very difficult problem of reading information from a single document, we consider the much easier problem of reading hundreds of millions of documents simultaneously, so that our system can extract facts that are stated manytimes by combining evidence from many documents. Second, our system begins with a given ontology that defines the types of information to be extracted, enabling it to focus its effort and to ignore most of the text that is irrelevant to the target ontology. Third, the system uses a new class of semi-supervised learning algorithms to learn how to extract information from web pages -- algorithms designed to achieve greater accuracy when given more complex ontologies. Our experiments show that this approach can produce knowledge bases containing tens of thousands of facts to populate given ontologies with approximately 90% accuracy, starting with only a handful of labeled training examples and 200 million unlabeled web pages.",Invited Talk Paper,,0,,0,Tom M.

In this paper we tackle one of the most popular CMS: Drupal. We enable site administrators to export their site content model and data to the Web of Data without requiring extensive knowledge on Semantic Web technologies. Our modules create RDFa annotations and -- optionally -- a SPARQL endpoint for any Drupal site out of the box. Likewise, we add the means to map the site data to existing ontologies on the Web with a search interface to find commonly used ontology terms. We also allow a Drupal site administrator to include existing RDF data from remote SPARQL endpoints on the Web in the site. When brought together, these features allow networked RDF Drupal sites that reuse and enrich Linked Data.

Proceedings","An important issue for the Semantic Web is how to combine open-world ontology languages with closed-world (non-monotonic) rule paradigms. Several proposals for hybrid languages allow concepts to be simultaneously defined by an ontology and rules, where rules may refer to concepts in the ontology and the ontology may also refer to predicates defined by the rules. Hybrid MKNF knowledge bases are one such proposal, for which both a stable and a well-founded semantics have been defined. The definition of Hybrid MKNF knowledge bases is parametric on the ontology language, in the sense that non-monotonic rules can extend any decidable ontology language. In this paper we define a query-driven procedure for Hybrid MKNF knowledge bases that is sound with respect to the original stable model-based semantics, and is correct with respect to the well-founded semantics. This procedure is able to answer conjunctive queries, and is parametric on an inference engine for reasoning in the ontology language. Our procedure is based on an extension of a tabled rule evaluation to capture reasoning within an ontology by modeling it as an interaction with an external oracle and, with some assumptions on the complexity of the oracle compared to the complexity of the ontology language, maintains the data complexity of the well-founded semantics for hybrid MKNF knowledge bases.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Matthias Knorr;Terrance Swift;José Júlio Alferes,3,"http://data.semanticweb.org/pdfs/iswc/2009/paper424.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-04930-9_1",2

While recent efforts have focused on developing efficient methods for traditional data processing, analytical processing which typically involves more complex queries has received much less attention. The use of cost effective parallelization techniques such as Google's Map-Reduce offer significant promise for achieving Web scale analytics. However, currently available implementations are designed for simple data processing on structured data. In this paper, we present a language, RAPID, for scalable ad-hoc analytical processing of RDF data on Map-Reduce frameworks. It builds on Yahoo's Pig Latin by introducing primitives based on a specialized join operator, the MD-join, for expressing analytical tasks in a manner that is more amenable to parallel processing, as well as primitives for coping with semi-structured nature of RDF data.

Customer data is the most important kind of core business entity a company uses repeatedly across many business processes and systems, and customer data management (CDM) is becoming critical for enterprises because it keeps a single, complete and accurate record of customers across the enterprise. Existing CDM systems focus on integrating customer data from all customer-facing channels and front and back office systems through multiple interfaces, as well as publishing customer data to different applications. To make the effective use of the CDM system, this paper investigates semantic query and analysis over the integrated and centralized customer data, enabling automatic classification and relationship discovery.

Using the jABC as a common frame helps highlighting the essential differences and similarities.

Proceedings","Ontology Modularization techniques identify coherent and often reusable regions within an ontology. The ability to identify such modules, thus potentially reducing the size or complexity of an ontology for a given task or set of concepts is increasingly important in the Semantic Web as domain ontologies increase in terms of size, complexity and expressivity. To date, many techniques have been developed, but evaluation of the results of these techniques is sketchy and somewhat ad hoc. Theoretical properties of modularization algorithms have only been studied in a small number of cases. This paper presents an empirical analysis of a number of modularization techniques, and the modules they identify over a number of diverse ontologies, by utilizing objective, task-oriented measures to evaluate the fitness of the modules for a number of statistical classification problems.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Terry Payne;Paul Doran;Ignazio Palmisano;Valentina Tamma,4,"http://data.semanticweb.org/pdfs/iswc/2009/paper484.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-04930-9_9",2

Proceedings","The Semantic Web fosters novel applications targeting a more efficient and satisfying exploitation of the data available on the web, e.g. faceted browsing of linked open data. Large amounts and high diversity of knowledge in the Semantic Web pose the challenging question of appropriate relevance ranking for producing fine-grained and rich descriptions of the available data, e.g. to guide the user along most promising knowledge aspects. Existing methods for graph-based authority ranking lack support for fine-grained latent coherence between resources and predicates (i.e. support for link semantics in the linked data model). In this paper, we present TripleRank, a novel approach for faceted authority ranking in the context of RDF knowledge bases. TripleRank captures the additional latent semantics of Semantic Web data by means of statistical methods in order to produce richer descriptions of the available data. We model the Semantic Web by a 3-dimensional tensor that enables the seamless representation of arbitrary semantic links. For the analysis of that model, we apply the PARAFAC decomposition, which can be seen as a multi-modal counterpart to Web authority ranking with HITS. The result are groupings of resources and predicates that characterize their authority and navigational (hub) properties with respect to identified topics. We have applied TripleRank to multiple data sets from the linked open data community and gathered encouraging feedback in a user evaluation where TripleRank results have been exploited in a faceted browsing scenario.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Steffen Staab;Thomas Franz;Sergej Sizov;Antje Schultz,4,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-04930-9_14,http://data.semanticweb.org/pdfs/iswc/2009/paper279.pdf",2

We extended the query capabilities of SPARQL with search capabilities to provide integrated access to structured, semi-structured and unstructured data sources. Every data source in the enterprise is potentially within the scope of e-discovery identification. So we use some common enterprise structured data sources that provide product and organizational information to guide the search and restrict it to a manageable scale. We use hybrid search and query to conduct a rich high-level search, which identifies the key people and products to coarsely locate relevant data-sources. Furthermore the product and organizational data sources are also used to increase recall which is a key requirement for e-discovery Identification.",Semantic Web In Use Track Paper,,0,,0,Andy Seaborne;Dave Grosvenor,2,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-04930-9_51,http://data.semanticweb.org/pdfs/iswc/2009/in-use/paper200.pdf",2

Proceedings","The focus of web search is moving away from returning relevant documents towards returning structured data as results to user queries. A vital part in the architecture of search engines are link-based ranking algorithms, which however are targeted towards hypertext documents. Existing ranking algorithms for structured data, on the other hand, require manual input of a domain expert and are thus not applicable in cases where data integrated from a large number of sources exhibits enormous variance in vocabularies used. In such environments, the authority of data sources is an important signal that the ranking algorithm has to take into account. This paper presents algorithms for prioritising data returned by queries over web datasets expressed in RDF. We introduce the notion of naming authority which provides a correspondence between identifiers and the sources which can speak authoritatively for these identifiers. Our algorithm uses the original PageRank method to assign authority values to data sources based on a naming authority graph, and then propagates the authority values to identifiers referenced in the sources. We conduct performance and quality evaluations of the method on a large web dataset. Our method is schema-independent, requires no manual input, and has applications in search, query processing, reasoning, and user interfaces over integrated datasets.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Andreas Harth;Sheila Kinsella;Stefan Decker,3,"http://data.semanticweb.org/pdfs/iswc/2009/paper403.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-04930-9_18",2

Proceedings","In this paper, we report on a technology-transfer effort on using the Semantic Web (SW) technologies, esp. ontology matching, for solving a real-life library problem: book subject indexing. Our purpose is to streamline one library's book description process by suggesting new subjects based on descriptions created by other institutions, even when the vocabularies used are different. The case at hand concerns the National Library of the Netherlands (KB) and the network of Dutch local public libraries. We present a prototype subject suggestion tool, which is directly connected to the KB production cataloguing environment. We also report on the results of a user study and evaluation to assess the feasibility of exploiting state-of-the art techniques in such a real-life application. Our prototype demonstrates that SW components can be seamlessly plugged into the KB production environment, which potentially brings a higher level of flexibility and openness to networked Cultural Heritage (CH) institutions. Technical hurdles can be tackled and the suggested subjects are often relevant, opening up exciting new perspectives on the daily work of the KB. However, the general performance level should be made higher to warrant seamless embedding in the production environment-notably by considering more contextual metadata for the suggestion process.",Semantic Web In Use Track Paper,,0,,0,Antoine Isaac;Shenghui Wang;Stefan Schlobach;Dirk Kramer;Johan Stapel;Lourens van der Meij,6,"http://data.semanticweb.org/pdfs/iswc/2009/in-use/paper104.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-04930-9_53",2

Proceedings","The field of biomedicine has embraced the Semantic Web probably more than any other field. As a result, there is a large number of biomedical ontologies covering overlapping areas of the field. We have developed BioPortal - an open community-based repository of biomedical ontologies. We analyzed ontologies and terminologies in BioPortal and the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), creating more than 4 million mappings between concepts in these ontologies and terminologies based on the lexical similarity of concept names and synonyms. We then analyzed the mappings and what they tell us about the ontologies themselves, the structure of the ontology repository, and the ways in which the mappings can help in the process of ontology design and evaluation. For example, we can use the mappings to guide users who are new to a field to the most pertinent ontologies in that field, to identify areas of the domain that are not covered sufficiently by the ontologies in the repository, and to identify which ontologies will serve well as background knowledge in domain-specific tools. While we used a specific (but large) ontology repository for the study, we believe that the lessons we learned about the value of a large-scale set of mappings to ontology users and developers are general and apply in many other domains.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Clement Jonquet;Natalya Noy;Nigam H.

Currently, none of the available spreadsheet-to-RDF wrappers supports cross tables and tables where data is not aligned in rows. Similar to RDF123, XLWrap is based on template graphs where fragments of triples can be mapped to specific cells of a spreadsheet. Additionally, it features a full expression algebra based on the syntax of OpenOffice Calc and various shift operations, which can be used to repeat similar mappings in order to wrap cross tables including multiple sheets and spreadsheet files. The set of available expression functions includes most of the native functions of OpenOffice Calc and can be easily extended by users of XLWrap. Additionally, XLWrap is able to execute SPARQL queries, and since it is possible to define multiple virtual class extents in a mapping specification, it can be used to integrate information from multiple spreadsheets. XLWrap supports a special identity concept which allows to link anonymous resources (blank nodes) - which may originate from different spreadsheets - in the target graph.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Wolfram Wöß;Andreas Langegger,2,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-04930-9_23,http://data.semanticweb.org/pdfs/iswc/2009/paper203.pdf",2
