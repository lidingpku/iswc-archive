DESCRIPTION:chair: Pavel Shvaiko\,Ming Mao\,Kavitha Srinivas\,Jérôme Euz
 enat\,Ernesto Jiménez-Ruiz\nabstract: Ontology matching is a key interope
 rability enabler for the Semantic Web\, as well as a useful tactic in some
  classical data integration tasks dealing with the semantic heterogeneity 
 problem. It takes the ontologies as input and determines as output an alig
 nment\, that is\, a set of correspondences between the semantically relate
 d entities of those ontologies. These correspondences can be used for vari
 ous tasks\, such as ontology merging\, data translation\, query answering 
 or navigation on the web of data. Thus\, matching ontologies enables the k
 nowledge and data expressed in the matched ontologies to interoperate.\n -

 s stock of the emergent work and chart the research agenda with interactiv
 e sessions to brainstorm ideas and potential applications of collective in
 telligence to solving AI hard semantic web problems. The Global Brain Sema
 ntic Web—a Semantic Web interleaving a large number of human and machine
  computation—has great potential to overcome some of the issues of the c
 urrent Semantic Web. In particular\, semantic technologies have been deplo
 yed in the context of a wide range of information management tasks in scen
 arios that are increasingly significant in both technical (data size\, var
 iety and complexity of data sources) and economical terms (industries addr
 essed and their market volume). For many of these tasks\, machine-driven a
 lgorithmic techniques aiming at full automation do not reach a level of ac
 curacy that many production environments require. Enhancing automatic tech
 niques with human computation capabilities is becoming a viable solution i
 n many cases. We believe that there is huge potential at the intersection 
 of these disciplines - large scale\, knowledge-driven\, information manage
 ment and crowdsourcing - to solve technically challenging problems purpose
 fully and in a cost effective manner.\n -CrowdSem Session 1 (09:00-10:30)\

DESCRIPTION:chair: Ziqi Zhang\,Heiko Paulheim\,Claudia D'Amato\,Anna Lisa 
 Gentile\nabstract: This workshop focuses on the exploitation of Linked Dat
 a for Web Scale Information Extraction (IE)\, which concerns extracting st
 ructured knowledge from unstructured/semi-structured documents on the Web.
  One of the major bottlenecks for the current state of the art in IE is th
 e availability of learning materials (e.g.\, seed data\, training corpora)
 \, which\, typically are manually created and are expensive to build and m
 aintain. Linked Data (LD) defines best practices for exposing\, sharing\, 
 and connecting data\, information\, and knowledge on the Semantic Web usin
 g uniform means such as URIs and RDF. It has so far been created a giganti
 c knowledge source of Linked Open Data (LOD)\, which constitutes a mine of
  learning materials for IE. However\, the massive quantity requires effici
 ent learning algorithms and the unguaranteed quality of data requires robu
 st methods to handle redundancy and noise.LD4IE intends to gather research
 ers and practitioners to address multiple challenges arising from the usag
 e of LD as learning material for IE tasks\, focusing on (i) modelling user
  defined extraction tasks using LD\; (ii) gathering learning materials fro
 m LD assuring quality (training data selection\, cleaning\, feature select
 ion etc.)\; (iii) robust learning algorithms for handling LD\; (iv) publis
 hing IE results to the LOD cloud.\n -LD4IE Session 1 (09:00-10:30)\n -LD4I

 tract: In one study it was reported that there is 500 times as much data i
 n the hidden or deep web\, then there is in crawlable\, indexable web page
 s. Most of this data is stored in relational databases. Hence\, the Semant
 ic Web’s promise of Web-scale data integration will only live up to its 
 true promise with the inclusion of legacy relational database management s
 ystems (RDBMS). Two new\, interrelated and complementary W3C standards\, 
 “Direct Mapping of Relational Data to RDF” and “R2RML: RDB to RDF Ma
 pping Language”\, are poised to enable this data into the web of Linked 
 Data. This tutorial will introduce\, contrast and explain the preferred so
 lution organizations embodies by these two standards. The tutorial will al
 so include a hands-on session.\n -Relational Database to RDF Session 1 (09

  there is a continuing demand for uncertainty reasoning technology among S
 emantic Web researchers and developers\, and the URSW workshop creates a u

  visual (i.e. diagrammatic) notations that are more readily accessible to 
 those without substantial mathematical training. This tutorial will demons
 trate a formal visual logic\, called concept diagrams\, suitable for ontol
 ogy engineering. The notation has been designed with regard to cognitive t
 heories combined with an emphasis on being sufficiently expressive to mode
 l rich domains. The tutorial introduces concept diagrams and attendees wil
 l gain knowledge of how to apply concept diagrams for ontology engineering

 ease. However\, applications that exploit Linked Data are not yet widespre
 ad. Reasons may include a lack of suitable solutions for a number of open 
 problems. The diversity and dynamics of LOD sources have brought new chall
 enges in seamless data integration\, dynamic discovery\, provenance tracki
 ng\, and quality assessment at the Web scale. Addressing these issues requ
 ires joint community efforts from both LOD provision and consumption persp
 ectives\, including the development and investigation of concepts that can
  lead towards the realisation of a sustainable Linked Data ecosystem. The 
 objective of this workshop is to provide a focused venue for academic and 
 industrial discussions on concepts\, algorithms\, infrastructure and tools

 : We (the Semantic Web community) are responsible for the conception of te
 chnologies that enable large scale integration and mining of personal and 
 public information in all domains of society. This brings unprecedented ad
 vantages\, assists humans\, organisations and systems with problem solving
 \, enables innovation and increases productivity. It makes everything more
  transparent. However this transparency comes at a price: the loss of our 
 privacy. There has been growing awareness within the community of the need
  to address privacy and security concerns. To date the focus has been on r
 esearching specific privacy and security models and frameworks\, for examp
 le for access control\, obfuscation\, anonymization\, aggregation\, licens
 ing\, etc. However we are “putting the cart before the horse”\, we nee
 d to identify clear privacy and security requirements before proposing tec
 hnical solutions. With this workshop we aim at the following goals: First\
 , raise awareness that the technologies the community are working on have 
 global societal consequences. Vice versa\, our research can be guided by d
 etermining a road map for desirable privacy goals. We aim to determine fir
 st steps towards identifying desirable goals. Second\, raise awareness of 
 interconnections between the different communities that are involved in We
 b privacy and security ­ e.g.\, policy makers\, users\, social sciences a
 nd computer scientists and provide a platform for interconnection and comm
 unication. Third\, determine the next steps that need to be conducted in o
 rder to broaden the level of engagement between the relevant parties.\n -P

 Taylor\,Cory Henson\,Amit Sheth\nabstract: It is estimated that today ther
 e are 4 billion mobile devices that can act as sensors\, including active 
 and passive RFID tags. This is complemented by an even larger number of fi
 xed sensors recording observations of a wide variety of modalities. Geogra
 phically distributed sensor nodes are capable of forming ad hoc networking
  topologies\, with nodes expected to be dynamically inserted and removed f
 rom a network. The sensors are increasingly being connected with Web infra
 structure\, and the Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) standard developed by the 
 Open Geospatial Consortium is widely being adopted in industry\, governmen
 t and academia alike. While such frameworks provide some interoperability\
 , semantics is increasingly seen as key enabler for integration of sensor 
 data and broader Web information systems. Analytical and reasoning capabil
 ities afforded by Semantic Web standards and technologies are considered i
 mportant for developing advanced applications that go from capturing obser
 vations to recognition of events and ultimately developing comprehensive s
 ituational awareness. Defense\, transportation\, global enterprise\, and n
 atural resource management industries are leading the rapid emergence of a
 pplications in commercial\, civic\, and scientific operations that involve
  sensors\, web\, services and semantics. Semantic technologies are often p
 roposed as important components of complex\, cross-jurisdictional\, hetero
 geneous\, dynamic information systems. The needs and opportunities arising
  from the rapidly growing capabilities of networked sensing devices are a 
 challenging case.\n -SSN 2013 Session 1 (09:00-10:30)\n -SSN 2013 Session

  technologies. Current adoption is mainly restricted to methodologies prov

DESCRIPTION:chair: Stefan Schlobach\,Markus Krötzsch\,Irene Celino\,Emanu
 ele Della Valle\nabstract: More and more applications require real-time pr
 ocessing of massive\, dynamically generated\, ordered data\; where order i
 s often an essential factor reflecting recency\, proximity or relevance. S
 tream and rank-aware data management techniques are progressively providin
 g reactive and reliable query answering over such massive datasets\, allow
 ing integration of highly dynamic sources. Key to their success is the use
  of streaming algorithms that harness the natural or enforceable orders in
  the data. The expressive power of Semantic technologies is needed in thos
 e applications\, but Semantic Technologies risk being unable to address th
 e needs of those applications\, because they do not consider ordering as a
 n essential property. Ranking results is often seen as an “added task”
 \, performed after inference\, without affecting the inference process\, w
 hich is order-agnostic. However\, we perceive a trend towards order-aware 
 semantic technologies: both researchers and practitioners understand that 
 order matters in reasoning over massive and highly dynamic data. The idea 
 of Stream Reasoning is gaining considerable momentum. Some top-k query ans
 wering techniques for Linked Data appeared. Several works are considering 
 SPARQL query answering on RDF annotated with labels partially ordered. The
  Description Logic community is investigating top-k ontological query answ
 ering. This workshop aims at bringing together this growing and very activ
 e community interested in integrating ordering with reasoning by using met
 hods inspired by stream and rank-aware data management. We see this worksh
 op as a first step to stimulate and guide a paradigm shift in semantic tec
 hnologies.\n -OrdRing 2013 Session 1 (13:45-15:30)\n -OrdRing 2013 Session

 gnificant fraction of the pages on the web are generated from structured d
 atabases. A longstanding goal of the semantic web initiative is to get web
 masters to make this structured data directly available on the web. The pa
 th towards this objective has been rocky at best. While there have been so
 me notable wins (such as RSS and FOAF)\, many of the other initiatives hav
 e seen little industry adoption. Learning from these earlier attempts has 
 guided the development of schema.org\, which appears to have altered the t
 rajectory. Two years after its launch over 4 million Internet domains are 
 are using schema.org markup. In this talk\, we recount the history behind 
 the early efforts and try to understand why some of them succeeded while o

DESCRIPTION:chair: Pascal Hitzler\npresenter: Peter Fox\nabstract: As coll
 aborative\, or network science spreads into more science\, engineering and
  medical fields\, both the participants and their funders have expressed a
  very strong desire for highly functional data and information capabilitie
 s that are a) easy to use\, b) integrated in a variety of ways\, c) levera
 ge prior investments and keep pace with rapid technical change\, and d) ar
 e not expensive or time-consuming to build or maintain. In response\, and 
 based on our accumulated experience over the last decade and a maturing of
  several key semantic web approaches\, we have adapted\, extended\, and in
 tegrated several open source applications and frameworks that handle major
  portions of functionality for these platforms. At minimum\, these functio
 ns include: an object-type repository\, collaboration tools\, an ability t
 o identify and manage all key entities in the platform\, and an integrated
  portal to manage diverse content and applications\, with varied access le
 vels and privacy options. At the same time\, there is increasing attention
  to how researchers present and explain results based on interpretation of
  increasingly diverse and heterogeneous data and information sources. With
  the renewed emphasis on good data practices\, informatics practitioners h
 ave responded to this challenge with maturing informatics-based approaches
 . These approaches include\, but are not limited to\, use case development
 \; information modeling and architectures\; elaborating vocabularies\; med
 iating interfaces to data and related services on the Web\; and traceable 
 provenance. The current era of data-intensive research presents numerous c
 hallenges to both individuals and research teams. In environmental science
  especially\, sub-fields that were data-poor are becoming data-rich (volum
 e\, type and mode)\, while some that were largely model/ simulation driven
  are now dramatically shifting to data-driven or least to data-model assim
 ilation approaches. These paradigm shifts make it very hard for researcher
 s used to one mode to shift to another\, let alone produce products of the
 ir work that are usable or understandable by non-specialists. However\, it
  is exactly at these frontiers where much of the exciting environmental sc
 ience needs to be performed and appreciated. XVIII Research networks (even
  small ones) need to deal with people\, and many intellectual artifacts pr
 oduced or consumed in research\, organizational and/our outreach activitie
 s\, as well as the relations among them. Increasingly these networks are m
 odeled as knowledge networks\, i.e. graphs with named and typed relations 
 among the 'nodes'. Some important nodes are: people\, organizations\, data
 sets\, events\, presentations\, publications\, videos\, meetings\, reports
 \, groups\, and more. In this heterogeneous ecosystem\, it is important to
  use a set of common informatics approaches to co-design and co-evolve the
  needed science data platforms based on what real people want to use them 
 for. We present our methods and results for information modeling\, adaptin
 g\, integrating and evolving a networked data science and information arch
 itecture based on several open source technologies (e.g. Drupal\, VIVO\, t
 he Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network\; CKAN\, and the Global Handle 
 System\; GHS) and many semantic technologies. We discuss the results in th
 e context of the Deep Carbon Virtual Observatory and the Global Change Inf
 ormation System\, and conclude with musings on how the smart mediation amo
 ng the components is modeled and managed\, and its general applicability a
 nd ecacy.

DESCRIPTION:chair: Kerry Taylor\npresenter: Jane Hunter\nabstract: This ke
 ynote will describe a number of projects being undertaken at the Universit
 y of Queensland eResearch Lab that are pushing Semantic Web technologies t
 o their limit to help solve grand challenges in the environmental\, cultur
 al and medical domains. In each of these use cases\, we are integrating mu
 lti-modal data streams across space\, time\, disciplines\, formats and age
 ncies to infer and expose new knowledge through rich multi-layered and int
 eractive visualizations. We are developing hypothesis-based query interfac
 es that provide evidence to validate or refute hypotheses and decision sup
 port services that recommend the optimum actions given current or predicte
 d scenarios. We are using ontologies to influence and adapt government pol
 icies by linking policy-driven implementations\, investments and managemen
 t actions to real world indicators. Through evaluation of the methods and 
 assessment of the achievements associated with the OzTrack\, eReef\, Skele
 tome and Twentieth Century in Paint projects\, I will highlight those Sema
 ntic Web technologies that have worked for us and our user communities\, t
 hose that haven't and those that need improvement. Finally\, I will discus
 s what I believe will be the major outstanding research challenges facing 
 Semantic Big Data in the next 5 years and those research areas with the gr
 eatest potential for impact.
