Most data in the current web is managed by relational databases. Thus, it is imperative for the Semantic Web community to offer easily implemented solutions to bridging relational database content and RDF. Direct mappings means to use the SQL schema to create an OWL ontology and use it to represent the data in RDF. Direct mapping methods have an advantage that they are, intrinsically, automated. If a SQL-schema was created using contemporary model-driven software engineering tools, the resulting OWL ontology can be semantically rich. However, few SQL databases are so developed and therefore semantically weak. We suggest that direct-mapping methods can be integrated by a refinement process. We propose a two step bootstrapping architecture of integrating relational databases with the Semantic Web by first generating a “database-derived putative ontology” and second, refining the putative ontology with a domain ontology and database individuals.",Poster/Demo Paper,,0,,0,Juan F.

The Web portal www.verwaltungskooperation.at aims to share knowledge on collaboration projects. A semantic wiki approach was used to facilitate best practice documentation with Semantic Web and Web 2.0 technology. Intercommunal cooperation has a long tradition among Austrian towns, cities, and municipalities. Much like in its German-speaking neighbour countries, this issue has become a subject of increased interest to Austria and has been intensely discussed in the last years. Apart from basic analyses of intercommunal cooperation in various scientific journals or the arrangement of expert meetings; the number of practical examples of cross-municipal cooperation is growing. In 2006, the KDZ published a book on intercommunal cooperation including a description of some 50 best-practice examples. In late 2007, the decision was made to publish these examples on a Web platform in order to make them available to a broader public and to enable the static information contained in the book to become dynamic Web content, editable by interested users. The use of the latest semantic wiki technologies for the new platform www.verwaltungskooperation.at is an example of the emergence of Web 2.0 applications with semantic technologies, sometimes referred to as “Web 3.0” or “Social Semantic Web”.",Poster/Demo Paper,,0,,0,Bernhard Krabina,1,http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-401/iswc2008pd_submission_23.pdf,1

This poster presents a method and system which elegantly generates relational schema, OWL ontology, and semantic mapping between them, for any given OO model.

We illustrate that this method is able to capture interesting global properties of the underlying RDF graph using study cases from different knowledge domains. We also show how well noc-order behaves even if the underlying data has some noise, i.e. superfluous and/or erroneous data. Finally, we discuss how information about the importance of different predicates either based on their informativeness, prior semantic information about them or user preferences can be incorporated into this measure.

A cornerstone in this effort constitutes the precise and complete description of the fundamental entities within this domain.

Such issues impede the move towards semantic standardization needed for their intended knowledge managment task. Rather it leads to inconsistencies, fragmentation and overlap both within and inbetween different biomedical ontologies. In light of this we introduce BioTop and ChemTop, two top-domain ontologies containing definitions for the most important, foundational entities necesarry to describe the various phenomena in biology and chemistry.

However, the openness of the Semantic Web means that the notion of there being common domain ontologies sufficient to cater for the requirements of a diverse range of consumers and producers of services has become untenable. In these types of environments it is necessary to consider that no ontology can be expected to remain unchanged throughout its lifetime. However, the dynamism and the large scale of the environment prevent the use of traditional ontology evolution techniques, where changes are mediated by a knowledge engineer [3]. We argue that the ability to estimate the impact of change a priori, i.e. before performing the change itself, is crucial, since this estimate can be used to assess the usefulness of the change. We assume that agents are capable of rational behaviour, and that they decide whether to change the ontology they commit to if the cost of the change (in terms of reclassiﬁcation of knowledge) is offset by the beneﬁts derived from the ability of a system to acquire new capabilities and therefore to achieve new tasks (or answer new queries, in the case of knowledge based systems). However, the agent’s decision making process follows the principle of bounded rationality [5]: agents operate with limited computational resources, and with partial knowledge of the environment [4]. We present an approach that evaluates the impact of change on an ontology a priori, without using reasoning, by estimating which set of axioms in an ontology is impacted by the change.",Poster/Demo Paper,,0,,0,Luigi Iannone;Ignazio Palmisano;Valentina Tamma;Terry Payne;Paul Doran,5,http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-401/iswc2008pd_submission_41.pdf,1

The method does not require a training set and is based on measuring the semantic similarity of the thematic graph created from a text document and the ontology fragments created by the projection of the defined contexts. The domain ontology together with the defined contexts effectively becomes the classifier, as it includes all of the necessary semantic and structural features of the classification categories.

This paper presents preliminary results towards a framework for the specification and enforcement of reactive Semantic Web policies, which can be used in order to allow agents to automatically perform advanced and powerful tasks, which can neither be addressed by existing Semantic Web policy languages nor by recent efforts towards reactivity on the Semantic Web.",Poster/Demo Paper,,0,,0,Ricardo Amador;Philipp Kärger;Daniel Olmedilla;Jose Julio Alferes,4,http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-401/iswc2008pd_submission_39.pdf,1

Our demonstration illustrates the effectiveness of this architecture to enable the metadata federation such that the global query, search and analysis on the metadata are feasible.

However, searching for entities is difficult in Second Life, since there is only a very limited way to describe entities. With semSL it becomes possible for every user to add arbitrary tags or key/value pair based descriptions to entities in Second Life, or to create typed links between entities. Such typed links can even be established between entities in Second Life and resources from the Semantic Web. The description data for all such entities is centrally stored at a server external to Second Life. The data is encoded in RDF, and is publicly accessible via a SPARQL endpoint.

First, the result quality increases monotonically and converges with each evolution, offering ``anytime'' behaviour with arbitrary trade-off between computation time and query results; in addition, the level of approximation can be tuned by varying the size of the bloomfilters. Secondly, through bloomfilter compression we can fit large graphs in main memory, reducing the need for disk I/O during query evaluation.

Proceedings","For easing the exchange of news, the International Press Telecommunication Council (IPTC) has developed the NewsML Architecture (NAR), an XML-based model that is specialized into a number of languages such as NewsML G2 and EventsML G2. As part of this architecture, specific controlled vocabularies, such as the IPTC News Codes, are used to categorize news items together with other industry-standard thesauri. While news is still mainly in the form of text-based stories, these are often illustrated with graphics, images and videos. Media-specific metadata formats, such as EXIF, DIG35 and XMP, are used to describe the media. The use of different metadata formats in a single production process leads to interoperability problems within the news production chain itself. It also excludes linking to existing web knowledge resources and impedes the construction of uniform end-user interfaces for searching and browsing news content. In order to allow these different metadata standards to interoperate within a single information environment, we design an OWL ontology for the IPTC News Architecture, linked with other multimedia metadata standards. We convert the IPTC NewsCodes into a SKOS thesaurus and we demonstrate how the news metadata can then be enriched using natural language processing and multimedia analysis and integrated with existing knowledge already formalized on the Semantic Web. We discuss the method we used for developing the ontology and give rationale for our design decisions. We provide guidelines for re-engineering schemas into ontologies and formalize their implicit semantics.

Proceedings","A number of ontology repositories provide access to the growing collection of ontologies on the Semantic Web. Some repositories collect ontologies automatically by crawling the Web; in other repositories, users submit ontologies themselves. In addition to providing search across multiple ontologies, the added value of ontology repositories lies in the metadata that they may contain. This metadata may include information provided by ontology authors, such as ontologies’ scope and intended use; feedback provided by users such as their experiences in using the ontologies or reviews of the content; and mapping metadata that relates concepts from different ontologies. In this paper, we focus on the ontology-mapping metadata and on community-based method to collect ontology mappings. More speciﬁcally, we develop a model for representing mappings collected from the user community and the metadata associated with the mapping. We use the model to bring together more than 30,000 mappings from 7 sources. We also validate the model by extending BioPortal—a repository of biomedical ontologies that we have developed—to enable users to create single concept-to-concept mappings in its graphical user interface, to upload and download mappings created with other tools, to comment on the mappings and to discuss them, and to visualize the mappings and the corresponding metadata.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Mark A.

The idea is to combine the TBox inferencing capabilities of the DL algorithms and the scalability of the rule paradigm over large ABoxes. Towards this end, we define a framework that uses a DL reasoner to reason over the TBox of the ontology (hybrid-like) and a rule engine to apply a domain-specific version of ABox-related entailments (homogeneous-like) that are generated by TBox queries to the DL reasoner. The DLE framework enhances the entailment-based OWL reasoning paradigm in two directions. Firstly, it disengages the manipulation of the TBox semantics from any incomplete entailment-based approach, using the efficient DL algorithms. Secondly, it achieves faster application of the ABox-related entailments and efficient memory usage, comparing it to the conventional entailment-based approaches, due to the low complexity and the domain-specific nature of the entailments.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Nick Bassiliades;Georgios Meditskos,2,"https://github.com/lidingpku/iswc-archive/raw/master/paper/iswc-2008/53180273.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-88564-1_18",2

Proceedings","Efficient and scalable discovery mechanisms are critical for enabling service-oriented architectures on the Semantic Web. The majority of currently existing approaches focuses on centralized architectures, and deals with efficiency typically by pre-computing and storing the results of the semantic matcher for all possible query concepts. Such approaches, however, fail to scale with respect to the number of service advertisements and the size of the ontologies involved. On the other hand, this paper presents an efficient and scalable index-based method for Semantic Web service discovery that allows for fast selection of services at query time and is suitable for both centralized and P2P environments. We employ a novel encoding of the services descriptions, allowing the match between a request and an advertisement to be evaluated in constant time, and we index these representations to prune the search space, reducing the number of comparisons required. Given a desired ranking function, the search algorithm can retrieve the top-k matches progressively, i.e., better matches are computed and returned first, thereby further reducing the search engine's response time. We show also how this search can be performed efficiently in a suitable structured P2P overlay network.

Proceedings","Currently proposed SemanticWeb Services technologies allow the semantic description of Web services so that software agents are able to discover, invoke, compose and monitor these services with a high degree of automation. This is achieved by marking up services with ontology-based semantic descriptions. The OWL Services (OWL-S) ontology is an upper ontology in OWL language, providing essential vocabularies to semantically describe Web services. Currently OWL-S services can only be developed independently, if one service is unavailable then finding a suitable alternative would require an expensive and difficult global search/match. It is desirable to have a new OWL-S construct that can systematically support substitution tracing as well as incremental development and reuse for services. Introducing inheritance relationship (IR) into OWLS is a natural solution. However, OWL-S, as well as most of the other currently discussed formalisms for Semantic Web Services such as WSMO or SAWSDL, has yet to define a concrete and self-contained mechanism of establishing inheritance relationships among services, which we believe is very important for the automated creation and discovery of Web services as well as human organization of services into a taxonomy-like structure. In this paper, we extend OWL-S with the possibility to define and maintain inheritance relationships between services. Through the definition of an additional “inheritance profile”, inheritance relationships can be stated and reasoned about. Two types of IRs are allowed to grant service developers the choice to respect the “contract” between services or not.

Proceedings","The growing popularity of social tagging systems promises to alleviate the knowledge bottleneck that slows the full materialization of the Semantic Web, as these systems are cheap, extendable, scalable and respond quickly to user needs. However, for the sake of knowledge workflow, one needs to find a compromise between the ungoverned nature of folksonomies and the controlled vocabulary of domain-experts. In this paper, we address this concern by first devising a method that automatically combines folksonomies with domain-expert ontologies resulting in an enriched folksonomy. We then introduce a new algorithm based on frequent itemsets mining that efficiently learns an ontology over the concepts present in the enriched folksonomy. Moreover, we propose a new benchmark for ontology evaluation, which is used in the context of information finding, since this is one of the leading motivations for using ontologies in social tagging systems, to quantitatively assess our method. We conduct experiments on real data and empirically show the effectiveness of our approach.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Leandro Balby Marinho;Lars Schmidt-Thieme;Krisztian Buza,3,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-88564-1_17,https://github.com/lidingpku/iswc-archive/raw/master/paper/iswc-2008/53180257.pdf",2

Proceedings","More and more ontologies have been published and used widely on the web such as FOAF, CYC and WordNet. In order to make good use of an ontology, especially a new and large scale ontology, we need methods to help under- stand it first. Identifying potentially important concepts and relations in an ontology is an intuitive but challeng- ing method. In this paper, inspired by the Stream of Con- sciousness theory, we first define six features for potential important concepts and relation from the ontological struc- tural point of view. Then a simple yet effective Concept- And-Relation-Ranking (CARRank) algorithm is proposed to simultaneously rank the importance of concepts and rela- tions. Different from the traditional ranking methods, the importance of concepts and the weights of relations reinforce one another in CARRank in an iterative manner. Such an iterative process is proved to be convergent both in princi- ple and by experiments. Our experimental results show that CARRank has a similar convergent speed as the PageRank- like algorithms, but a more reasonable ranking result.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Kehong Wang;Ling Feng;Juanzi Li;Gang Wu,4,"https://github.com/lidingpku/iswc-archive/raw/master/paper/iswc-2008/53180033.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-88564-1_3",2

Proceedings","The emergence of web based systems in which users can annotate items, raises the question of the semantic interoperability between vocabularies originating from collaborative annotation processes, often called folksonomies, and keywords assigned in a more traditional way. If collections are annotated according to two systems, e.g. with tags and keywords, the annotated data can be used for instanced based mapping between the vocabularies. The basis for this kind of matching is an appropriate similarity measure between concepts, based on their distribution as annotations. In this paper we propose a new similarity measure that can take advantage of some special properties of user generated metadata. We have evaluated this measure with a set of articles from Wikipedia which are classified according to the topic structure of Wikipedia and that are annotated by users of the bookmarking service del.icio.us as well. The results using the new measure are significantly better than those obtained using standard similarity measures proposed for this task in the literature. We argue that the measure also has benefits for instance based mapping of more traditionally developed vocabularies. Finally, this method opens possibilities for instance based mapping of annotation data in the absence of a collection described according to both systems.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Rogier Brussee;Christian Wartena,2,"https://github.com/lidingpku/iswc-archive/raw/master/paper/iswc-2008/53180351.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-88564-1_23",2

Proceedings","A justification for an entailment in an OWL ontology is a minimal subset of the ontology that is sufficient for that entailment to hold. Since justifications respect the syntactic form of axioms in an ontology, they are usually neither syntactically nor semantically minimal. This paper presents two new subclasses of justifications - laconic justications and precise justications. Laconic justications only consist of axioms that do not contain any redundant parts. Precise justications can be derived from laconic justications and are characterised by the fact that they consist of flat, small axioms, which facilitate the generation of semantically minimal repairs. Formal denitions for both types of justication are presented. In contrast to previous work in this area, these definitions make it clear as to what exactly parts of axioms are. In order to demonstrate the practicability of computing laconic, and hence precise justications, an algorithm is provided and results from an empirical evaluation carried out on several published ontologies are presented. The evaluation showed that laconic/precise justications can be computed in a reasonable time for entailments in a range of ontologies that vary in size and complexity. It was found that in half of the ontologies sampled there were entailments that had more laconic/precise justications than regular justications.

Proceedings","The Semantic Web is a distributed environment for knowledge representation and reasoning. The distributed nature brings with it failing data sources and inconsistencies between autonomous knowledge bases. To reduce problems resulting from unavailable sources and to improve performance, caching can be used. Caches, however, raise new problems of imprecise or outdated information. We propose to distinguish between certain and cached information when reasoning on the semantic web, by extending the well known FOUR bilattice of truth and knowledge orders to FOUR-C, taking into account cached information. We discuss how users can be offered additional information about the reliability of inferred information, based on the availability of the corresponding information sources. We then extend the framework towards FOUR-T , allowing for multiple levels of trust on data sources. In this extended setting, knowledge about trust in information sources can be used to compute, how well an inferred statement can be trusted and to resolve inconsistencies arising from connecting multiple data sources. We redefine the stable model and well founded semantics on the basis of FOUR-T, and reformalize the Web Ontology Language OWL2 based on logical bilattices, to augment OWL knowledge bases with trust based reasoning.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Simon Schenk,1,"https://github.com/lidingpku/iswc-archive/raw/master/paper/iswc-2008/53180526.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-88564-1_34",2

Proceedings","The documentation of Enterprise Research Planning (ERP) systems is usually (1) extremely large and (2) combines various views from the business and the technical implementation perspective. Also, a very specific vocabulary has evolved, in particular in the SAP domain (e.g. SAP Solution Maps or SAP software module names). This vocabulary is not clearly mapped to business management terminology and concepts. It is a well-known problem in practice that searching in SAP ERP documentation is difficult, because it requires in-depth knowledge of a large and proprietary terminology. We propose to use ontologies and automatic annotation of such large HTML software documentation in order to improve the usability and accessibility, namely of ERP help files. In order to achieve that, we have developed an ontology and prototype for SAP ERP 6.0. Our approach integrates concepts and lexical resources from (1) business management terminology, (2) SAP business terminology, (3) SAP system terminology, and (4) Wordnet synsets. We use standard GATE/KIM technology to annotate SAP help documentation with respective references to our ontology. Eventually, our approach consolidates the knowledge contained in the SAP help functionality at a conceptual level. This allows users to express their queries using a terminology they are familiar with, e.g. referring to general management terms. Despite a widely automated ontology construction process and a simplistic annotation strategy with minimal human intervention, we experienced convincing results. For an average query linked to an action and a topic, our technology returns more than 3 relevant resources, while a naïve term-based search returns on average only about 0.2 relevant resources.",Semantic Web In Use Track Paper,,0,,0,Andreas Wechselberger;Martin Hepp,2,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-88564-1_49,https://github.com/lidingpku/iswc-archive/raw/master/paper/iswc-2008/53180755.pdf",2

Proceedings","This paper describes the first steps towards developing a methodology for testing and evaluating the performance of reasoners for the probabilistic description logic P-SHIQ(D). Since P-SHIQ(D) is a relatively new formalism for handling uncertainty in DL knowledge bases, no such methodology has been proposed so far. Moreover there are no sufficiently large probabilistic ontologies to be used as test suites. In addition, since the reasoning services in P-SHIQ(D) are mostly query oriented, there is no single problem (like classification or realization in classical DL) that could be an obvious candidate for benchmarking. All these issues make it hard to evaluate the performance of reasoners, reveal the complexity bottlenecks and assess the effect of optimization strategies. This paper aims at alleviating these important problems by making the following contributions: First, it describes a probabilistic ontology that has been developed for the real-life domain of breast cancer and which poses significant challenges for the state-of-art P-SHIQ(D) reasoners. Second, it explains a systematic approach to generating a series of probabilistic reasoning problems that allow to evaluate the reasoning performance and shed light on what makes reasoning in P-SHIQ(D) hard in practice. Finally, the paper explains the optimization strategy that helps to overcome some of the difficulties of reasoning revealed during the experiments. The impact of the strategy is also demonstrated using the developed evaluation methodology.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Bijan Parsia;Pavel Klinov,2,"https://github.com/lidingpku/iswc-archive/raw/master/paper/iswc-2008/53180209.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-88564-1_14",2

A more systematic characterization and validation of tag similarity in terms of formal representations of knowledge is still lacking. Here we address this issue and anayze several measures of tag similarity: Each measure is computed on data from the social bookmarking system del.icio.us and a semantic grounding is provided by mapping pairs of similar tags in the folksonomy to pairs of synsets in Wordnet, where we use validated measures of semantic distance to characterize the semantic relation between the mapped tags.

Proceedings","Metadata management is an important aspect of today's enterprise information systems. Metadata management systems are growing from tool-specific repositories to enterprise-wide metadata repositories. In this context, one challenge is the management of the evolving metadata whose schema or meta-model itself may evolve, e.g., dynamically-added properties, which are often hard to predict upfront at the initial meta-model design time; another challenge is to organize the metadata by semantically-rich classification schemes. In this paper, we present a practical system which provides support for users to dynamically manage semantically-rich properties and classifications in the IBM WebSphere Metadata Server (MDS) by integrating an OWL ontology repository. To enable the smooth acceptance of Semantic Web technologies for developers of commercial software which must run 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, the system is designed to consist of integrated modeling paradigms, with an integrated query language and runtime repository. Specifically, we propose the modeling of dynamic properties on structured metadata as OWL properties and the modeling of classification schemes as OWL ontologies for metadata classification. We present a natural extension to OQL (Object Query Language)-like query language to embrace dynamic properties and metadata classification. We also observe that hybrid storage, i.e., horizontal tables for structured metadata and vertical triple tables for dynamic properties and classification, is suitable for the storage and query processing of co-existing structured metadata and semantic metadata. We believe that our study and experience are not specific to MDS, but are valuable for the community trying to apply Semantic Web technologies to the structured data management area.",Semantic Web In Use Track Paper,,0,,0,Bob Schloss;Chen Wang;Yue Pan;John Colgrave;Shengping Liu;Guotong Xie;Yang Yang;Feng Cao;Cassio Santos;Kevin Shank,10,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-88564-1_56,https://github.com/lidingpku/iswc-archive/raw/master/paper/iswc-2008/53180853.pdf",2

Proceedings","As with the decentralized nature of the Semantic Web, a lot of terms (classes and properties) have been published by various parties, to be shared for describing resources. Terms are usually defined based on other terms, and thus a directed dependence relation is formed. The study of term dependence is a foundation work and is important for many other tasks, such as ontology search, maintenance, and distributed reasoning on the Web scale. In this paper, we propose a notion of term dependence on the Semantic Web, and analyze the complex network characteristics of the term dependence graph and the vocabulary dependence graph. The graphs analyzed in our experiments are constructed from a data set that contains 1,278,233 terms in 3,039 vocabularies.

Proceedings","Re-using and combining multiple ontologies on the Web is bound to lead to inconsistencies between the combined vocabularies. Even many of the ontologies that are in use today turn out to be inconsistent once some of their implicit knowledge is made explicit. However, robust and efficient methods to deal with inconsistencies are lacking from current Semantic Web reasoning systems, which are typically based on classical logic. In earlier papers, we have proposed the use of syntactic relevance functions as a method for reasoning with inconsistent ontologies. In this paper, we extend that work to the use of semantic distances. We show how Google distances can be used to develop semantic relevance functions to reason with inconsistent ontologies. In essence we are using the implicit knowledge hidden in the Web for explicit reasoning purposes. We have implemented this approach as part of the PION reasoning system. We report on experiments with several realistic ontologies. The test results show that a mixed syntactic/semantic approach can significantly improve reasoning performance over the purely syntactic approach. Furthermore, our methods allow to trade-off computational cost for inferential completeness. Our experiment shows that we only have to give up a little quality to obtain a high performance gain.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Frank van-Harmelen;Zhisheng Huang,2,"https://github.com/lidingpku/iswc-archive/raw/master/paper/iswc-2008/53180177.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-88564-1_12",2

Proceedings","It has been largely recognized that navigational capabilities are fundamental for graph databases query languages. However, although RDF is a directed labeled graph data format, the W3C Recommendation query language for RDF, SPARQL, only provides limited navigational functionalities. This has motivated several authors to propose extensions of SPARQL, or alternative query languages, that offer functionalities for navigating RDF data. In particular, we argued in [6] that nested regular expressions are appropriate to overcome this limitation, and we proposed a query language called nSPARQL that extends SPARQL with this type of expressions. In this paper, we continue with the investigation of nSPARQL. First, we show that nested regular expressions can be evaluated efficiently; if the appropriate data structure is used to store RDF graphs, then the evaluation of a nested regular expression E over an RDF graph G can be computed in time O(|G|*|E|). Second, as RDF graphs may contain RDFS vocabulary, we study how the navigational capabilities of nSPARQL can be used to evaluate queries according to the predefined semantics of RDFS. Evaluating queries which involve the RDFS vocabulary is challenging, and there is not yet consensus in the Semantic Web community on how to define a query language for RDFS. In this respect, we show that nSPARQL is expressive enough to answer SPARQL queries involving RDFS vocabulary by directly traversing the input RDF graphs. Moreover, we also prove that nesting is necessary to obtain this result. Namely, we show that, in general, regular expressions alone cannot be used to obtain the answer of a SPARQL query involving RDFS vocabulary.",Research Track Paper,,0,,0,Claudio Gutierrez;Marcelo Arenas;Jorge A.
