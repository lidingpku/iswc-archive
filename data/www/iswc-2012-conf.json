                            "abstract": "Ontology mappings are often assigned a weight or confidence factor by matchers. Nonetheless, few semantic accounts have been given so far for such weights. This paper presents a formal semantics for weighted mappings between different ontologies. It is based on a classificational interpretation of mappings: if O1 and O2 are two ontologies used to classify a common set X , then mappings between O1 and O2 are interpreted to encode how elements of X classified in the concepts of O1 are re-classified in the concepts of O2, and weights are interpreted to measure how precise and complete re-classifications are. This semantics is justifiable by extensional practice of ontology matching. It is a conservative extension of a semantics of crisp mappings. The paper also includes properties that relate mapping entailment with description logic constructors.",

One important part of this project is to establish owl:sameAs links among structured data sources. Such links indicate equivalent instances that refer to the same real-world object. The problem of discovering owl:sameAs links between pairwise data sources is called instance matching. Most of the existing approaches addressing this problem rely on the quality of prior schema matching, which is not always good enough in the LOD scenario. In this paper, we propose a schema-independent instance-pair similarity metric based on several general descriptive features. We transform the instance matching problem to the binary classification problem and solve it by machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, we employ some transfer learning methods to utilize the existing owl:sameAs links in LOD to reduce the demand for labeled data. We carry out experiments on some datasets of OAEI2010. The results show that our method performs well on real-world LOD data and outperforms the participants of OAEI2010.",

Emerging solutions are using ontologies for expressive representation of concepts in the domain of sensing and perception, which enable advanced integration and interpretation of heterogeneous sensor data. The computational complexity of OWL, however, seriously limits its applicability and use within resource-constrained environments, such as mobile devices. To overcome this issue, we employ OWL to formally define the inference tasks needed for machine perception - explanation and discrimination - and then provide efficient algorithms for these tasks, using bit-vector encodings and operations. The applicability of our approach to machine perception is evaluated on a smart-phone mobile device, demonstrating dramatic improvements in both efficiency and scale.",

Several RDF/S Knowledge Bases (KBs) rely heavily on blank nodes as they are convenient for representing complex attributes or resources whose identity is unknown but their attributes (either literals or associations with other resources) are known. In this paper we show how we can exploit blank nodes anonymity in order to reduce the delta (diff) size when comparing such KBs. The main idea of the proposed method is to build a mapping between the bnodes of the compared KBs for reducing the delta size. We prove that finding the optimal mapping is NP-Hard in the general case, and polynomial in case there are not directly connected bnodes. Subsequently we present various polynomial algorithms returning approximate solutions for the general case. For making the application of our method feasible also to large KBs we present a signature-based mapping algorithm with n logn complexity. Finally, we report experimental results over real and synthetic datasets that demonstrate significant reductions in the sizes of the computed deltas. For the proposed algorithms we also provide comparative results regarding delta reduction, equivalence detection and time efficiency.",

However, the widely-used time-decay-based approach worsens the sparsity problem because it deemphasizes old item transactions. We introduce two ideas to solve the sparsity problem. First, we divide the users' transactions into epochs i.e. time periods, and identify epochs that are dominated by interests similar to the current interests of the active user. Thus, it can eliminate dissimilar transactions while making use of similar transactions that exist in prior epochs. Second, we use a taxonomy of items to model user item transactions in each epoch. This well captures the interests of users in each epoch even if there are few transactions. It suits the situations in which the items transacted by users dynamically change over time; the semantics behind classes do not change so often while individual items often appear and disappear. Fortunately, many taxonomies are now available on the web because of the spread of the Linked Open Data vision. We can now use those to understand dynamic user interests semantically. We evaluate our method using a dataset, a music listening history, extracted from users' tweets and one containing a restaurant visit history gathered from a gourmet guide site.

First, it is often quite difficult to even determine which concepts have had their meaning altered by a change. Second, once a concept change is pinpointed, the problem of distinguishing whether the concept is directly or indirectly affected by a change has yet to be tackled. To address the first issue, various principled notions of ``semantic diff'' (based on deductive inseparability) have been proposed in the literature and shown to be computationally practical for the expressively restricted case of ELHr-terminologies. However, problems arise even for such limited logics as ALC: First, computation gets more difficult, becoming undecidable for logics such as SROIQ which underly the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Second, the presence of negation and disjunction make the standard semantic difference too sensitive to change: essentially, any logically effectual change always affects all terms in the ontology. In order to tackle these issues, we formulate the central notion of finding the minimal change set based on model inseparability, and present a method to differentiate changes which are specific to (thus directly affect) particular concept names. Subsequently we devise a series of computable approximations, and compare the variously approximated change sets over a series of versions of the NCI Thesaurus (NCIt).",

The costs are based on information about the instances of classes and properties that are extracted from a model abstraction built by an OWL reasoner. A static and a dynamic algorithm are presented which use these costs to find optimal or near optimal execution orders for the atoms of a query. For the dynamic case, we improve the performance by exploiting an individual clustering approach that allows for computing the cost functions based on one individual sample from a cluster. Our experimental study shows that the static ordering usually outperforms the dynamic one when accurate statistics are available. This changes, however, when the statistics are less accurate, e.g., due to non-deterministic reasoning decisions.",

While the accuracy of automatic approaches has continuously improved, human contributions remain a key ingredient of the process: this input serves as a valuable source of domain knowledge that is used to train the algorithms and to validate and augment automatically computed alignments. In this paper, we introduce CROWDMAP, a model to acquire such human contributions via microtask crowdsourcing. For a given pair of ontologies, CROWDMAP translates the alignment problem into microtasks that address individual alignment questions, publishes the microtasks on an online labor market, and evaluates the quality of the results obtained from the crowd. We evaluated the current implementation of CROWDMAP in a series of experiments using ontologies and reference alignments from the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative and the crowdsourcing platform CrowdFlower. The experiments clearly demonstrated that the overall approach is feasible, and can improve the accuracy of existing ontology alignment solutions in a fast, scalable, and cost-effective manner.",

The drawbacks of this process are manifold. Most importantly, it is very time-consuming as the experts have to carry out several search processes and must often read several documents. In this article, we present DeFacto (Deep Fact Validation) - an algorithm for validating facts by finding trustworthy sources for it on the Web. DeFacto aims to provide an effective way of validating facts by supplying the user with relevant excerpts of webpages as well as useful additional information including a score for the confidence DeFacto has in the correctness of the input fact.",

In this paper, we address this problem by finding alignments between concepts from multiple Linked Data sources. Instead of only considering the existing concepts present in each ontology, we hypothesize new composite concepts defined as disjunctions of conjunctions of (RDF) types and value restrictions, which we call restriction classes, and generate alignments between these composite concepts. This extended concept language enables us to find more complete definitions and to even align sources that have rudimentary ontologies, such as those that are simple renderings of relational databases. Our concept alignment approach is based on analyzing the extensions of these concepts and their linked instances. Having explored the alignment of conjunctive concepts in our previous work, in this paper, we focus on concept coverings (disjunctions of restriction classes). We present an evaluation of this new algorithm to Geospatial, Biological Classification, and Genetics domains. The resulting alignments are useful for refining existing ontologies and determining the alignments between concepts in the ontologies, thus increasing the interoperability in the Linked Open Data Cloud.",

We explore how to express the notion of a domain in terms usable for an ontology matching tool, and we examine various methods to decide what constitutes the domain of a given dataset. We show how we can use this in a matching tool, and study the effect of domain knowledge on the quality of the alignment. We perform evaluations for two scenarios: Last.fm artists and UMLS medical terms. To quantify the added value of domain knowledge, we compare our domain-aware matching approach to a standard approach based on a manually created reference alignment. The results indicate that the proposed domain-aware approach indeed outperforms the standard approach, with a large effect on ambiguous concepts but a much smaller effect on unambiguous concepts.",

Order is an important property of data that can be exploited to speed up query processing. State-of-the-art SPARQL engines underuse order, and top-k queries are mostly managed with a materialize-then-sort processing scheme that computes all the matching solutions (e.g. thousands) even if only a limited number k (e.g. ten) are requested. The SPARQL-RANK algebra is an extended SPARQL algebra that treats order as a first class citizen, enabling efficient split-and-interleave processing schemes that can be adopted to improve the performance of top-k SPARQL queries. In this paper we propose an incremental execution model for SPARQL-RANK queries, we compare the performance of alternative physical operators, and we propose a rank-aware join algorithm optimized for native RDF stores. Experiments conducted with an open source implementation of a SPARQL-RANK query engine based on ARQ show that the evaluation of top-k queries can be sped up by orders of magnitude.",

However, efficiently discovering Web APIs and the relevant documentations on the Web is still a challenging task even with the best resources available on the Web. In this paper we cast the problem of detecting the Web API documentations as a text classification problem of classifying a given Web page as Web API associated or not. We propose a supervised generative topic model called feature latent Dirichlet allocation (feaLDA) which offers a generic probabilistic framework for automatic detection of Web APIs. feaLDA not only captures the correspondence between data and the associated class labels, but also provides a mechanism for incorporating side information such as labeled features automatically learned from data that can effectively help improving classification performance. Extensive experiments on our Web APIs documentation dataset shows that the feaLDA model outperforms three strong supervised baselines including naive Bayes, support vector machines, and the maximum entropy model, by over 3% in classification accuracy. In addition, feaLDA also gives superior performance when compared against other existing supervised topic models.",

As the real-life provenance records can likely cover thousands of data items and derivation steps, one of the pressing challenges becomes development of formal frameworks for their automated verification. In this paper, we consider data expressed in standard Semantic Web ontology languages, such as OWL, and define a novel verification formalism called provenance specification logic, building on dynamic logic. We validate our proposal by modeling the test queries presented in The First Provenance Challenge, and conclude that the logic core of such queries can be successfully captured in our formalism.",

Minimal module extraction and uniform interpolation assign an absolute priority to one of these requirements, thereby limiting the possibilities to influence the other two. We propose a novel technique for EL that does not require such an extreme prioritization.

Herein, we propose a hybrid query execution approach that returns fresher results from a broader range of sources vs. the centralised scenario, while speeding up results vs. the live scenario. We first compare results from two public SPARQL stores against current versions of the Linked Data sources they cache; results are often missing or out-of-date. We thus propose using coherence estimates to split a query into a sub-query for which the cached data have good fresh coverage, and a sub-query that should instead be run live. Finally, we evaluate different hybrid query plans and split positions in a real-world setup. Our results show that hybrid query execution can improve freshness vs. fully cached results while reducing the time taken vs. fully live execution.",

Instance-based matching is known to be a useful technique for matching ontologies that have different names and different structures. A key problem in instance matching of types, however, is scaling the matching algorithm to (a) handle types with a large number of instances, and (b) efficiently match a large number of type pairs. We propose the use of state-of-the art locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) techniques to vastly improve the scalability of instance matching across multiple types. We show the feasibility of our approach with DBpedia and Freebase, two different type systems with hundreds and thousands of types, respectively. We describe how these techniques can be used to estimate containment or equivalence relations between two type systems, and we compare two different LSH techniques for computing instance similarity.",

A variant of distant supervision learns several relations in parallel, enabling a new method of rule filtering. The system detects both binary and n-ary relations. We target 39 relations from Freebase, for which 3M sentences extracted from 20M web pages serve as the basis for learning an average of 40K distinctive rules per relation. Employing an efficient dependency parser, the average run time for each relation is only 19 hours. We compare these rules with ones learned from local corpora of different sizes and demonstrate that the Web is indeed needed for a good coverage of linguistic variation.",

Although several lossless approaches have been developed for this exact purpose, they do not offer theoretical guarantees with respect to their performance. In this paper, we address this drawback by presenting the first Link Discovery approach with theoretical quality guarantees. In particular, we prove that given an achievable reduction ratio r, our Link Discovery approach HR3 can achieve a reduction ratio r'<=r in a metric space where distances are measured by the means of a Minkowski metric of any order p >= 2. We compare HR3 and the HYPPO algorithm implemented in LIMES 0.5 with respect to the number of comparisons they carry out. In addition, we compare our approach with the algorithms implemented in the state-of-the-art frameworks LIMES 0.5 and SILK 2.5 with respect to runtime. We show that HR3 outperforms these previous approaches with respect to runtime in each of our four experimental setups.",

These reasoners are much more efficient than fully-fledged OWL 2 reasoners, but they are not complete for ontologies containing (even if just a few) axioms outside the relevant fragment. In this paper, we propose a novel classification technique that combines an OWL 2 reasoner and an efficient reasoner for a given fragment in such a way that the bulk of the workload is assigned to the latter. Reasoners are combined in a black-box modular manner, and the specifics of their implementation (and even of their reasoning technique) are irrelevant to our approach.",

This class of solutions promises both to facilitate the integration of research data with other relevant sources of information and also to support more intelligent forms of querying and exploration. However, an issue which has only been partially addressed is that of generating and characterizing semantically the relations that exist between research areas. This problem has been traditionally addressed by manually creating taxonomies, such as the ACM classification of research topics. However, this manual approach is inadequate for a number of reasons: these taxonomies are very coarse-grained and they do not cater for the finegrained research topics, which define the level at which typically researchers (and even more so, PhD students) operate. Moreover, they evolve slowly, and therefore they tend not to cover the most recent research trends. In addition, as we move towards a semantic characterization of these relations, there is arguably a need for a more sophisticated characterization than a homogeneous taxonomy, to reflect the different ways in which research areas can be related. In this paper we propose Klink, a new approach to i) automatically generating relations between research areas and ii) populating a bibliographic ontology, which combines both machine learning methods and external knowledge, which is drawn from a number of resources, including Google Scholar and Wikipedia. We have tested a number of alternative algorithms and our evaluation shows that a method relying on both external knowledge and the ability to detect temporal relations between research areas performs best with respect to a manually constructed standard.",

In consideration of both publishers and consumers, the temporal dimension of data is important. In this paper we investigate the characterisation and availability of temporal information in Linked Data at large scale. Based on an abstract definition of temporal information we conduct experiments to evaluate the availability of such information using the data from the 2011 Billion Triple Challenge (BTC) dataset. Focusing in particular on the representation of temporal meta-information, i.e., temporal information associated with RDF statements and graphs, we investigate the approaches proposed in the literature, performing both a quantitative and a qualitative analysis and proposing guidelines for data consumers and publishers. Our experiments show that the amount of temporal information available in the LOD cloud is still very small; several different models have been used on different datasets, with a prevalence of approaches based on the annotation of RDF documents.",

In some circumstances, however, the data is meant to be complete in certain ways, and deducing new facts may be undesirable. Previous approaches to this issue have relied on syntactically specifying certain axioms as constraints or adding in new constructs for constraints, and providing a different or extended meaning for constraints that reduces or eliminates their ability to infer new facts without requiring the data to be complete. We propose to instead directly state that the extension of certain concepts and roles are complete by making them DBox predicates, which eliminates the distinction between regular axioms and constraints for these concepts and roles. This proposal eliminates the need for special semantics and avoids problems of previous proposals.",

The prime inference problem is computing answer probabilities, and it can be implemented using standard probabilistic database systems. We establish a PTime vs. #P dichotomy for the data complexity of this problem by lifting a corresponding result from probabilistic databases. We also demonstrate that query rewriting (backwards chaining) is an important tool for our framework, show that non-existence of a rewriting into first-order logic implies #P-hardness, and briefly discuss approximation of answer probabilities.",

                            "abstract": "Due to the high worst case complexity of the core reasoning problem for the expressive profiles of OWL 2, ontology engineers are often surprised and confused by the performance behaviour of reasoners on their ontologies. Even very experienced modellers with a sophisticated grasp of reasoning algorithms do not have a good mental model of reasoner performance behaviour. Seemingly innocuous changes to an OWL ontology can degrade classification time from instantaneous to too long to wait for. Similarly, switching reasoners (e.g., to take advantage of specific features) can result in wildly different classification times. In this paper we investigate performance variability phenomena in OWL ontologies, and present methods to identify subsets of an ontology which are performance-degrading for a given reasoner. When such (ideally small) subsets are removed from an ontology, and the remainder is much easier for the given reasoner to reason over, we designate them \u00e2\u0080\u009chot spots\u00e2\u0080?. The identification of these hot spots allows users to isolate difficult portions of the ontology in a principled and systematic way. Moreover, we devise and compare various methods for approximate reasoning and knowledge compilation based on hot spots. We verify our techniques with a select set of varyingly difficult ontologies from the NCBO BioPortal, and were able to, firstly, successfully identify performance hot spots against the major freely available DL reasoners, and, secondly, significantly improve classification time using approximate reasoning based on hot spots.",

In this paper, we present a semantic model of a Web API directory graph that captures relationships such as Web APIs, mashups, developers, and categories. We describe a novel configurable graph-based method for selection of Web APIs with personalised and temporal aspects. The method allows users to get more control over their preferences and recommended Web APIs while they can exploit information about their social links and preferences. We evaluate the method on a real-world dataset from ProgrammableWeb.com, and show that it provides more contextualised results than currently available popularity based rankings.",

Theoretical works have established worst-case complexity results for reasoning tasks for these languages. However, hardness of reasoning about individual ontologies has not been adequately characterised. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study to tackle this problem using machine learning techniques, covering over 350 real-world ontologies and four state-of-the-art, widely-used OWL 2 reasoners. Our main contributions are two-fold. Firstly, we learn various classifiers that accurately predict classification time for an ontology based on its metric values. Secondly, we identify a number of metrics that can be used to effectively predict reasoning performance. Our prediction models have been shown to be highly effective, achieving an accuracy of over 80%.",

There exist several proposals in the literature to annotate SPARQL query results with values from abstract models, adapting the seminal works on provenance for annotated relational databases. We provide an approach capable of providing provenance information for a large and significant fragment of SPARQL 1.1, including for the first time the major non-monotonic constructs under multiset semantics. The approach is based on the translation of SPARQL into relational queries over annotated relations with values of the most general m-semiring, and in this way also refuting a claim in the literature that the OPTIONAL construct of SPARQL cannot be captured appropriately with the known abstract models.",

In order to fully exploit these new avenues of performance improvement, computationally expensive workloads have to be expressed in a way that allows for fine-grained parallelism. In this paper, we address the problem of describing RDFS entailment in such a way. Different from previous work on parallel RDFS reasoning, we assume a shared memory architecture. We analyze the problem of duplicates that naturally occur in RDFS reasoning and develop strategies towards its mitigation, exploiting all levels of our architecture. We implement and evaluate our approach on two real-world datasets and study its performance characteristics on different levels of parallelization. We conclude that RDFS entailment lends itself well to parallelization but can benefit even more from careful optimizations that take into account intricacies of modern parallel hardware.",

This paper presents a new approach that allows domain experts to rapidly create semantic models of services by demonstration in an interactive web-based interface. First, the user provides examples of the service request URLs. Then, the system automatically proposes a service model the user can refine interactively. Finally, the system saves a service specification using a new expressive vocabulary that includes lowering and lifting rules. This approach empowers end users to rapidly model existing services and immediately use them to consume and produce linked data.",

Furthermore, we have developed a novel skew-resistant join algorithm that replicates tuples corresponding to popular keys. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach both on a synthetic benchmark known to generate complex queries (BSBM-BI) as well as on a Yahoo! case of data analysis using RDF data crawled from the web. Our results indicate that our system is indeed capable of processing huge datasets without pre-computed statistics while exhibiting good load-balancing properties.",

In this paper, we present a classification methodology for federated SPARQL queries. This methodology can be used by developers of federated querying approaches to compose a set of test benchmarks that cover diverse characteristics of different queries and allows for comparability. We further develop a heuristic called SPLODGE for automatic generation of benchmark queries that is based on this methodology and takes into account the number of sources to be queried and several complexity parameters. We evaluate the adequacy of our methodology and the query generation strategy by applying them on the 2011 billion triple challenge data set.",

With the increasing problem of too much streaming data but not enough tools to gain knowledge from them, researchers have set out for solutions in which Semantic Web technologies are adapted and extended for publishing, sharing, analysing and understanding streaming data. To help researchers and users comparing streaming RDF/SPARQL (strRS) engines in a standardised application scenario, we have designed SRBench, with which one can assess the abilities of a strRS engine to cope with a broad range of use cases typically encountered in real-world scenarios. The data sets used in the benchmark have been carefully chosen, such that they represent a realistic and relevant usage of streaming data. The benchmark defines a concise, yet comprehensive set of queries that cover the major aspects of strRS processing. Finally, our work is complemented with a functional evaluation on three representative strRS engines: SPARQLStream, C-SPARQL and CQELS. The presented results are meant to give a first baseline and illustrate the state-of-the-art.",

Hence, there is a need for combined geo-thematic logics that provide a sufficiently expressive query language allowing for FOL rewritability. The DL-Lite family of description logics is tailored towards FOL rewritability of query answering for unions of conjunctive queries, hence it is a suitable candidate for the thematic component of a combined geo-thematic logic. We show that a weak coupling of DL-Lite with the expressive region connection calculus RCC8 allows for FOL rewritability under a spatial completeness condition for the ABox. Stronger couplings allowing for FOL rewritability are possible only for spatial calculi as weak as the low-resolution calculus RCC2. Already a strong combination of DL-Lite with the low-resolution calculus RCC3 does not allow for FOL rewritability.",

We developed a tool for semantic annotation of digital documents and conducted an end-user study to evaluate its acceptance by and usability for non-expert users. This paper presents the results of this user study and discusses the lessons learned about both the semantic enrichment process and our methodology of exposing non-experts to semantic enrichment.",

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach of adding semantics as additional features into the training set for sentiment analysis. For each extracted entity (e.g. iPhone) from tweets, we add its semantic concept (e.g. ''Apple product'') as an additional feature, and measure the correlation of the representative concept with negative/positive sentiment. We apply this approach to predict sentiment for three different Twitter datasets. Our results show an average increase of F harmonic accuracy score for identifying both negative and positive sentiment of around 6.5% and 4.8% over the baselines of unigrams and part-of-speech features respectively. We also compare against an approach based on sentiment-bearing topic analysis, and find that semantic features produce better Recall and F score when classifying negative sentiment, and better Precision with lower Recall and F score in positive sentiment classification.",

Like GeoSPARQL, these new versions use OGC standards to represent geometries where the original versions used linear constraints. We study the performance of Strabon experimentally and show that it scales to very large data volumes and performs, most of the times, better than all other geospatial RDF stores it has been compared with.",

To this end, the W3C standard provides a simple system of deduction rules, which operate directly on the RDF syntax of OWL. Several similar systems have been studied. However, these approaches are usually complete for instance retrieval only. This paper asks if and how such methods could also be used for computing entailed subclass relationships. Checking entailment for arbitrary OWL RL class subsumptions is co-NP-hard, but tractable rule-based reasoning is possible when restricting to subsumptions between atomic classes. Surprisingly, however, this cannot be achieved in any RDF-based rule system, i.e., the W3C calculus cannot be extended to compute all atomic class subsumptions. We identify syntactic restrictions to mitigate this problem, and propose a rule system that is sound and complete for many OWL RL ontologies.",

Despite the rise in popularity of Attention-Information Networks (i.e. microblogging platforms) and the production of content within such platforms, no existing work has attempted to exploit the semantics of published content when predicting network links. In this paper we present an approach that fills this gap by a) predicting follower edges within a directed social network by exploiting concept graphs and thereby significantly outperforming a random baseline and models that rely solely on network topology information, and b) assessing the different behavior that users exhibit when making followee-addition decisions. This latter contribution exposes latent factors within social networks and the existence of a clear need for topical affinity between users for a follow link to be created.",

However, to avoid the information overload, such techniques often create an over-personalization effect, i.e. users are exposed only to the content systems assume they would like. To break this \"personalization bubble\" we introduce the notion of serendipity as a performance measure for recommendation algorithms. For this, we first identify aspects from the user perspective, which can determine level and type of serendipity desired by users. Then, we propose a user model that can facilitate such user requirements, and enables serendipitous recommendations. The use case for this work focuses on TV recommender systems, however the ultimate goal is to explore the transferability of this method to different domains. This paper covers the work done in the first eight months of research and describes the plan for the entire PhD trajectory.",

Yahoo research recently reported that 30% of all HTML pages contain structured data such as microdata, RDFa, or microformat. Although multilinguality of the web is a hurdle in information access, the rapid growth of the semantic web enables us to retrieve fine grained information across the language barrier. In this thesis, firstly, we focus on developing a methodology to perform cross-lingual semantic search over structured data (knowledge base), by transforming natural language queries into SPARQL. Secondly, we focus on improving the semantic similarity and relatedness measures, to overcome the semantic gap between the vocabulary in the knowledge base and the terms appearing in the query. The preliminary results are evaluated against the QALD-2 test dataset, which achieved a F1 score of 0.46, an average precision of 0.44, and an average recall of 0.48.",

We want to extract KPs by analyzing the structure of Web links from rich resources, such as Wikipedia.",

This problem is central to integrating and inter-linking semi-structured datasets. We are developing an online, unsupervised coreference resolution framework for heterogeneous, semi-structured data. The online aspect requires us to process new instances as they appear and not as a batch. The instances are heterogeneous in that they may contain terms from different ontologies whose alignments are not known in advance. Our framework encompasses a two-phased clustering algorithm that is both flexible and distributable, a probabilistic multidimensional attribute model that will support robust schema mappings, and a consolidation algorithm that will be used to perform instance consolidation in order to improve accuracy rates over time by addressing data sparseness.",

In our work, we target the problem of reconstructing provenance of files in a shared folder setting, assuming that only standard filesystem metadata are available. We propose a content-based approach that is able to reconstruct provenance automatically, leveraging several similarity measures and edit distance algorithms, adapting and integrating them into a multi-signal pipeline. We discuss our research methodology and show some promising preliminary results.",

However, domain descriptions such as XML Schemas are often available in early stages of the ontology development process. For my dissertation, I propose a method to convert XML Schemas to OWL ontologies in an automatic way. The approach addresses the transformation of any XML Schema documents by using the XML Schema metamodel, which is completely represented by the XML Schema Metamodel Ontology. Automatically, all Schema declarations and definitions are converted to class axioms, which are intended to be enriched with additional domain-specific semantic information in form of domain ontologies.",

The goal of my research is to verify the applicability of standard-compliant SPARQL for complex event processing tasks. If successful, semantic web standards RDF, SPARQL and OWL with their established base of tools have many other benefits for event processing including support for interconnecting disjoint vocabularies, enriching event information with linked open data and reasoning over semantically annotated content. A software platform capable of continuous incremental evaluation of multiple parallel SPARQL queries is a key enabler of the approach.",

In order to facilitate data utilization in the Semantic Web, without compromising the freedom of people to publish their data, one critical problem is to appropriately interlink such heterogeneous data. This interlinking process can also be referred to as Entity Coreference, i.e., finding which identifiers refer to the same real world entity. This proposal will investigate algorithms to solve this entity coreference problem in the Semantic Web in several aspects. The essence of entity coreference is to compute the similarity of instance pairs. Given the diversity of domains of existing datasets, it is important that an entity coreference algorithm be able to achieve good precision and recall across domains represented in various ways. Furthermore, in order to scale to large datasets, an algorithm should be able to intelligently select what information to utilize for comparison and determine whether to compare a pair of instances to reduce the overall complexity. Finally, appropriate evaluation strategies need to be chosen to verify the effectiveness of the algorithms.",

For all of the popular reasoners, in order to process an ontology, an implicit assumption is that the ontology should fit in primary memory. The memory requirements for a reasoner are already quite high, and considering the ever increasing size of the data to be processed and the goal of making reasoning Web scale, this assumption becomes overly restrictive. In our work, we study several distributed classification approaches for the description logic EL+ (a fragment of OWL 2 EL profile). We present the lessons learned from each approach, our current results, and plans for future work.",

Some variables and configurations that may have an impact on the behavior of these systems (e.g., network latency, data partitioning and query properties) are not sufficiently defined; this affects the results and repeatability of independent evaluation studies, and hence the insights that can be obtained from them. In this paper we evaluate FedBench, the most comprehensive testbed up to now, and empirically probe the need of considering additional dimensions and variables. The evaluation has been conducted on three SPARQL query federation systems, and the analysis of these results has allowed to uncover properties of these systems that would normally be hidden with the original testbeds.",

For direct consumption by users, Linked Data mashups, interfaces, and visualizations have become a popular research area. Many approaches in this field aim to make Linked Data interaction more user friendly to improve its accessibility for nontechnical users. A subtask for Linked Data interfaces is to present entities and their properties in a concise form. In general, these summaries take individual attributes and sometimes user contexts and preferences into account. But the objective evaluation of the quality of such summaries is an expensive task. In this paper we introduce a game-based approach aiming to establish a ground truth for the evaluation of entity summarization. We exemplify the applicability of the approach by evaluating two recent summarization approaches.",

Furthermore, the optimal design can be dependent not only on the task but also on the type of user. Evaluations can shed light on these issues; however, very few studies have focused on assessing the usability of semantic search systems. As semantic search becomes mainstream, there is growing need for standardised, comprehensive evaluation frameworks. In this study, we assess the usability and user satisfaction of different semantic search query input approaches (natural language and view-based) from the perspective of different user types (experts and casuals). Contrary to previous studies, we found that casual users preferred the form-based query approach whereas expert users found the graph-based to be the most intuitive. Additionally, the controlled-language model offered the most support for casual users but was perceived as restrictive by experts, thus limiting their ability to express their information needs.",

These steps are ordered with respect to their computational effort, following the idea of layered processing: questions are passed on along the pipeline only if they cannot be answered on the basis of earlier processing steps, thereby invoking computationally expensive operations only for complex queries that require them. In this paper we present an evaluation of the system on the dataset provided by the 2nd Open Challenge on Question Answering over Linked Data (QALD-2). The main, novel contribution is a systematic empirical investigation of the impact of the single processing components on the overall performance of question answering over linked data.",

                            "abstract": "In this paper we present the Quonto Inconsistent Data handler (QuID). QuID is a reasoner for OWL 2 QL that is based on the system Quonto and is able to deal with inconsistent ontologies. The central aspect of QuID is that it implements two different, orthogonal strategies for dealing with inconsistency: ABox repairing techniques, based on data manipulation, and consistent query answering techniques, based on query rewriting. Moreover, by exploiting the ability of Quonto to delegate the management of the ABox to a relational database system (DBMS), such techniques are potentially able to handle very large inconsistent ABoxes. For the above reasons, QuID allows for experimentally comparing the above two different strategies for inconsistency handling in the context of OWL 2 QL. We thus report on the experimental evaluation that we have conducted using QuID. Our results clearly point out that inconsistency-tolerance in OWL 2 QL ontologies is feasible in practical cases. Moreover, our evaluation singles out the different sources of complexity for the data manipulation technique and the query rewriting technique, and allows for identifying the conditions under which one method is more efficient than the other.",

However, current implemented engines have not been thoroughly evaluated to assess their capabilities. For reasonable systematic evaluations, in this work we propose a novel, customizable evaluation framework and a corresponding methodology for realistic data generation, system testing, and result analysis. Based on this evaluation environment, extensive experiments have been conducted in order to compare the state-of-the-art LSD engines wrt. qualitative and quantitative properties, taking into account the underlying principles of stream processing. Consequently, we provide a detailed analysis of the experimental outcomes that reveal useful findings for improving current and future engines.",

We compare the effectiveness of a series of approaches to select the best tags ranging from traditional IR techniques such as TF/IDF weighting to novel techniques based on ontological distances and latent Dirichlet allocation. All our experiments are run against a real corpus of tags and documents extracted from the ScienceWise portal, which is connected to ArXiv.org and is currently used by growing number of researchers.

Having survived the AI Winter of the 1980s, the opportunities that they saw in the largest, most interconnected computing platform imaginable were obviously compelling. With the subsequent success of the Semantic Web, however, our community seems to have stopped talking about many of the issues that researchers believe led to the AI Winter in the first place: the cognitive challenges in debugging and maintaining complex systems, the drift in the meanings ascribed to symbols, the situated nature of knowledge, the fundamental difficulty of creating robust models. These challenges are still with us; we cannot wish them away with appeals to the open-world assumption or to the law of large numbers. Embracing these challenges will allow us to expand the scope of our science and our practice, and will help to bring us closer to the ultimate vision of the Semantic Web.",

But in the last few years, we've seen many new Internet-based applications (such as Wikipedia, Linux, and prediction markets) where the key reasoning is done, not by machines, but by large groups of people. This talk will show how a relatively small set of design patterns can help understand a wide variety of these examples. Each design pattern is useful in different conditions, and the patterns can be combined in different ways to create different kinds of collective intelligence. Building on this foundation, the talk will consider how the Semantic Web might contribute to - and benefit from - these more human-intensive forms of collective intelligence.",

One popular approach to answering natural language questions involves filtering candidate answers based on precompiled lists of instances of common answer types (e.g., countries, animals, foods, etc.). Such a strategy is poorly suited to an open domain in which there is an extremely broad range of types of answers, and the most frequently occurring types cover only a small fraction of all answers. In this paper we present an alternative approach called TyCor, that employs soft filtering of candidates using multiple strategies and sources. We find that TyCor significantly outperforms a single-source, single-strategy hard filtering approach, demonstrating both that multi-source multi-strategy outperforms a single source, single strategy, and that its fault tolerance yields significantly better performance than a hard filter.",

However, applications from different providers are not able to interoperate due to incompatible interaction protocols or disparate data models. Instant messaging is a representative example of the current situation, where various competing applications keep emerging. To enforce interoperability at runtime and in a non-intrusive manner, mediators are used to perform the necessary translations and coordination between the heterogeneous applications. Nevertheless, the design of mediators requires considerable knowledge about each application as well as a substantial development effort. In this paper we present an approach based on ontology reasoning and model checking in order to generate correct-by-construction mediators automatically. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through a prototype tool and show that it synthesises mediators that achieve efficient interoperation of instant messaging applications.",

We adapt pure Artificial Intelligence diagnosis techniques to fully exploit knowledge which is captured through relevant semantics-augmented stream and static data from various domains. Our prototype of semantic-aware diagnosis of road traffic congestions, experimented in Dublin Ireland, works efficiently with large, heterogeneous information sources and delivers value-added services to citizens and city managers in quasi real-time.",

Neither search engine nor semantic web technologies alone have managed to provide usable systems for simple questions such as \"Find me a flat with a garden and more than two bedrooms near a supermarket.\" We introduce DEQA, a conceptual framework that achieves this elusive goal through combining state-of-the-art semantic technologies with effective data extraction. To that end, we apply DEQA to the UK real estate domain and show that it can answer a significant percentage of such questions correctly. DEQA achieves this by mapping natural language questions to SPARQL patterns. These patterns are then evaluated on an RDF database of current real estate offers. The offers are obtained using OXPATH, a state-of-the-art data extraction system, on the major agencies in the Oxford area and linked through LIMES to background knowledge such as the location of supermarkets.",

Emerging applications in Cyber Physical Systems such as Smart Power Grids that require continuous information monitoring and integration present novel opportunities and challenges for Semantic Web technologies. Semantic Web is promising to model diverse Smart Grid domain knowledge for enhanced situation awareness and response by multi-disciplinary participants. However, current technology does pose a performance overhead for dynamic analysis of sensor measurements. In this paper, we combine semantic web and complex event processing for stream based semantic querying. We illustrate its adoption in the USC Campus Micro-Grid for detecting and enacting dynamic response strategies to peak power situations by diverse user roles. We also describe the semantic ontology and event query model that supports this. Further, we introduce and evaluate caching techniques to improve the response time for semantic event queries to meet our application needs and enable sustainable energy management.",

Those datasets need to be integrated, but it is often hard to automatically achieve a high-quality interlinkage. Human Computation approaches can be employed to solve such a task where machines are ineffective. We argue that in this case not only people's background knowledge is useful to solve the task, but also people's physical presence and direct experience can be successfully exploited. In this paper we present UrbanMatch, a Game with a Purpose for players in mobility aimed at validating links between points of interest and their photos; we discuss the design choices and we show the high throughput and accuracy achieved in the interlinking task.",

The LOD2 Stack comprises new and substantially extended existing tools from the LOD2 project partners and third parties. The stack is designed to be versatile; for all functionality we define clear interfaces, which enable the plugging in of alternative third-party implementations. The architecture of the LOD2 Stack is based on three pillars: (1) Software integration and deployment using the Debian packaging system. (2) Use of a central SPARQL endpoint and standardized vocabularies for knowledge base access and integration between the different tools of the LOD2 Stack. (3) Integration of the LOD2 Stack user interfaces based on REST enabled Web Applications. These three pillars comprise the methodological and technological framework for integrating the very heterogeneous LOD2 Stack components into a consistent framework. In this article we describe these pillars in more detail and give an overview of the individual LOD2 Stack components. The article also includes a description of a real-world usage scenario in the publishing domain.",

A series of challenges are identified: namely, the heterogeneity of the domain and the lack of a common model, the volume of information and the number of data sets, the requirement for a low entry threshold to the system, the diversity of the input data, in terms of format, syntax and update frequency (streams vs static data), and the sensitivity of the information. We propose an approach for incremental and continuous integration of static and streaming data, based on Semantic Web technologies. The proposed system is unique in the literature in terms of handling of multiple integrations of available data sets in combination with flexible provenance tracking, privacy protection and continuous integration of streams. We report on lessons learnt from building the first prototype for Dublin.",

These NLP graphs can be measured with Precision and Recall against a ground truth graph representing what the documents actually say. When asking conjunctive queries on NLP graphs, the Recall of the query is expected to be roughly the product of the Recall of the relations in each conjunct. Since Recall is typically less than one, conjunctive query Recall on NLP graphs degrades geometrically with the number of conjuncts. We present an approach to address this Recall problem by hypothesizing links in the graph that would improve query Recall, and then attempting to find more evidence to support them. Using this approach, we confirm that in the context of answering queries over NLP graphs, we can use lower confidence results from NLP components if they complete a query result.",

They represent important sources of evolved knowledge that may be automatically integrated in decision support methods. Grounding clinical and radiographic findings in concepts defined by a biomedical ontology, e.g., the Human Phenotype Ontology, enables us to compute semantic similarity between them. In this paper, we focus on using such similarity measures to predict disorders on undiagnosed patient cases in the bone dysplasia domain. Different methods for computing the semantic similarity have been implemented. All methods have been evaluated based on their support in achieving a higher prediction accuracy. The outcome of this research enables us to understand the feasibility of developing decision support methods based on ontology-driven semantic similarity in the skeletal dysplasia domain.",

It is said that if \"raw data\" is openly available on the Web, it will be used by other people to do wonderful things. But, it would be better to show a use case together with that data, especially in the dawn of LOD. Therefore, we are proceeding with both of LOD content generation and its application for a specific domain. The application addresses an issue of information retrieval in the field, and the mechanism of LOD generation from the Web might be applied to the other domain. Firstly, we demonstrate the use of our mobile application, which searches a plant fitting the environmental conditions obtained by the smartphone's sensors. Then, we introduce our approach of the LOD generation, and present an evaluation showing its practical effectiveness.",

Hence, such a heterogeneity has to be addressed, while performing various data integration tasks. We report our experimental work on publishing some government linked open geo-metadata and geo-data of the Italian Trentino region. Specifically, we illustrate how 161 core geographic datasets were released by leveraging on the geo-catalogue application within the existing geo-portal. We discuss the lessons we learned from deploying and using the application as well as from the released datasets.",

We have published the RDF based serializations of all these ontologies and their metadata at sparql.bioontology.org. This dataset contains 203M triples, representing both content and metadata for the 300+ ontologies; and 9M mappings between terms. This endpoint can be queried with SPARQL which opens new usage scenarios for the biomedical domain. This paper presents lessons learned from having redesigned several applications that today use this SPARQL endpoint to consume ontological data.",

Entities covered by the Knowledge Graph include landmarks, celebrities, cities, sports teams, buildings, movies, celestial objects, works of art, and more. The graph enhances Google search in three main ways: by disambiguation of search queries, by search log-based summarization of key facts, and by explorative search suggestions. With this paper, we suggest a fourth way of enhancing Web search: through the addition of realtime coverage of what people say about real-world entities on social networks. We report on a browser extension that seamlessly adds relevant microposts from the social networking sites Google+, Facebook, and Twitter in form of a panel to Knowledge Graph entities. In a true Linked Data fashion, we interlink detected concepts in microposts with Freebase entities, and evaluate our approach for both relevancy and usefulness. The extension is freely available, we invite the reader to reconstruct the examples of this paper to see how realtime opinions may have changed since time of writing.",

However, multidimensional analysis has been observed to be dicult for analysts, due to the challenges of both presenting and navigating large datasets. This work explores how initial summarizations of multidimensional datasets can be generated for consuming parties (designed to reduce the number of data points which would need to be displayed) driven by summarization policies based on provided dataset values. Additionally, functionality for explaining the derivation of summarizations is being developed - in line with prior work on aiding analyst interactions with data processing systems. To help drive development of this work, as well as provide illustrative use cases, we are presently developing a dataset summarization generator as part of greater work being done in the Foresight and Understanding from Scientific Exposition (FUSE) program.",

While the current LOD contains hundreds of data sources with billions of triples, it has a small number of distinct relations compared with the large number of entities. On the other hand, Web pages are growing rapidly, which results in much larger number of textual contents to be exploited. With the popularity and wide adoption of open information extraction technology, extracting entities and relations among them from text at the Web scale is possible. In this paper, we present an approach to extract the subject individuals and the object counterparts for the relations from text and determine the most appropriate domain and range as well as the most confident dependency path patterns for the given relation based on the EM algorithm. As a preliminary results, we built a knowledge base for relations extracted from Chinese encyclopedias. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach to extract relations with reasonable domain, range and path pattern restrictions as well as high-quality triples.",

We will show how we can exploit blank node anonymity in order to reduce the delta size when comparing RDF/S KBs. We will show experimental results over real and synthetic data sets that demonstrate significant reductions of the sizes of the computed deltas, and how the reduced deltas can be visualized.

Proprietary event processing solutions do not have enough interoperation flexibility, easily leading to overlapping functions wasting hardware and software resources as well as data communications. Our goal is to verify the applicability of standard-compliant SPARQL for any complex event processing task. If found feasible, semantic web methods RDF, SPARQL and OWL have the built-in support for interconnecting disjoint vocabularies, enriching event information with linked open data and reasoning over semantically annotated content, yielding a very flexible event processing environment. Our approach is designed to meet these requirements. Our INSTANS platform based on continuous execution of interconnected SPARQL queries using the Rete-algorithm is a new approach showing improved performance for event processing tasks over current SPARQL-based solutions.",

To try and improve over the current state of affairs, we are developing a novel tool for exploring research data, which is called Rexplore. Rexplore builds on an intelligent algorithm for automatically identifying hierarchical and equivalence relations between research areas, to provide a variety of functionalities and visualizations to help users to make sense of a research area. These include visualizations to detect trends in research; ways to cluster authors according to several dynamic similarity measures; and fine-grained mechanisms for ranking authors, taking into account parameters such as ranking criterion, career stage, calendar years, publication venues, etc.",

On the other hand, the process of interlinking open data sources is actively pursued within the Linking Open Data (LOD) project. The number of entities and the number of properties describing semantic relationships between entities within the linked data cloud are very large. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-incentive approach based on LOD for entity annotation in the biomedical field. With this approach, we implement MeDetect, a prototype system to solve the problems mentioned above. The experimental results verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.",

However, in many use cases such as ontology alignment the ontologies might include many conflict sets, i.e. sets of axioms preserving the faults, thus making ontology diagnosis infeasible. In this paper we present a debugging approach based on a direct computation of diagnoses that omits calculation of conflict sets. Embedded in an ontology debugger, the proposed algorithm is able to identify diagnoses for an ontology which includes a large number of faults and for which application of standard diagnosis methods fails. The evaluation results show that the approach is practicable and is able to identify a fault in adequate time.",

In addition to the domain and source ontologies, the mapping algorithm requires a SPARQL query to determine the ontology mapping. Further, the mapping algorithm is dynamic; running each time a query is processed and producing only a partial mapping sufficient to reformulate the query. This approach enables the mapping algorithm to exploit query semantics to correctly choose among ontology mappings that are indistinguishable when only the ontologies are considered. Also, the mapping associates paths with paths, instead of entities with entities. This approach simplifies query reformulation. The sys- tem achieves favorable results when compared to the algorithms developed for Clio, the best automated relational data integration system.",

Quest allows to link the vocabulary of an ontology to the content of a relational database through mapping axioms. These are then used together with the ontology to answer a SPARQL query by means of a single SQL query that is executed over the database. Quest uses highly-optimised query rewriting techniques to generate the SQL query which not only takes into account the entailments of the ontology and data, but is also 'lean' and simple so that it can be executed efficiently by any SQL engine. Quest supports commercial and open source databases, including database federation tools like Teiid to allow for Ontology Based Data Integration of relational and other sources (e.g., CSV, Excel, XML). Here we will briefly describe Quest mapping language, the query answering process and the most relevant optimisation techniques used by the system. We will conclude with a brief description of the content of this demo.",

To solve this problem, there are a lot of researches about ontology mapping/alignment/matching. This paper shows an application called \u0093SPARQLoid\u0094 that is using a query rewriting method to enable the users to query any SPARQL endpoint with the user\u0092s own ontology even when their mappings are not reliable enough. Often ontology matching is very difficult problem and it sometimes produces mappings under a certain reliability. Based on the given reliability degrees on those mappings, SPARQLoid allows users to query data in the target SPARQL endpoints by using their own (or a specified certain) ontology under a control of sorting order based on their mapping reliability.",

Unlike the traditional scientific naming system, which is based on evolutionary relationships, it emphasizes the observable features of organisms. By independently naming the descriptions composed of sets of observational features, as well as maintaining connections to scientific names, it preserves the observational data used to identify organisms. The system is designed to support a peer-review mechanism for creating new names, and uses a controlled vocabulary encoded in the Web Ontology Language to represent the observational features. A prototype of the system is currently under development in collaboration with the Mushroom Observer website. It allows users to propose new names and descriptions, provide feedback on those proposals, and ultimately have them formally approved. This effort aims at offering the mycology community a knowledge base of fungal observational features and a tool for identifying fungal observations.",

However, its capabilities for reusing existing OWL artifacts in the creation of new artifacts is limited to the import of whole ontologies, even when only a small handful of classes, object properties, and so on (which we refer to generically as OWL components) are relevant. This situation can result in extremely large and unwieldy, or even broken, ontologies. To address this problem while still promoting ontology reuse, the OBI Consortium has elucidated the Minimum Information to Reference an External Ontology Term (MIREOT). We provide a suite of plugins to the Protege editor that greatly simplifies the use of MIREOT principles during ontology creation and editing.",

Reasons for that include one (or more) of the following research issues: lack of integrated development environments (IDEs, such as Visual Studio and Eclipse), poor programming language support, lack of standard testbeds and/or benchmarks, inadequate training, and perhaps the need for curricula revision. Properly addressing these issues requires interdisciplinary skills, and the collaboration between academia and industry. The First Workshop on Programming the Semantic Web invites submissions that explore the gap between today\u0092s semantic web challenges, particularly the ones related to dealing with large amounts of data, with the lack of adequate tools. We are looking for contributions that discuss, promote and further advance the programming facet of the semantic web, including the development of new languages, extension of existing ones, and the inclusion of semantic enabled capabilities into existing IDEs.",

Typically, such systems deal with information described in Semantic Web languages like OWL and RDF(S), and provide services such as storing, reasoning, querying, analysis, etc. There are two basic requirements for these systems. First, they have to satisfy an application\u0091s semantic requirements. Second, they must scale well in order to be of practical use. Given the sheer size and distributed nature of the Semantic Web, these requirements impose new challenges beyond those addressed by previous systems. This joint workshop consists of two tracks regarding scalability: one for knowledge base systems, and another for high-performance computing. We expect that the issue of scalability is going to challenge the Semantic Web for a long period of time and significant effort is needed in order to tackle the problem. This joint workshop seeks to bring together researchers and practitioners to share their recent ideas and progress towards building scalable systems for the Semantic Web; participants from related disciplines such as Supercomputing, and High-Performance Computing, Artificial Intelligence, Databases, Information Integration, are welcome.",

                            "abstract": "The Semantic Web, as a field, is undergoing a major shift. After 10 years of mainly foundations-driven research, we now see strong indicators that Semantic Web methods are entering mainstream technology, in a number of forms. The consequent rise in commercial interest will likely have a fundamental impact on the field. Some established research results will make it into mainstream applications. Others will become obsolete. Radically new ideas will emerge. It is thus the right time for the community to contemplate the way ahead. In this workshop, we will provide an exciting forum for the discussion of the future of the Semantic Web. Researchers and practitioners from all corners of the field are invited to provide their insights and projections. The event will focus on discussions and the exchange of ideas, and will use a mix of different styles of interaction between the participants. It is always good to try to look ahead and anticipate the development of a field. For the Semantic Web, it is now particularly important because recent developments indicate that Semantic Web technologies are entering the industrial mainstream. Schema.org and the Facebook Open Graph Protocol are bringing metadata to bear on the Web large-scale. IBM\u0091s Watson and Apple\u0091s Siri incorporate Semantic Technologies. Google is revamping its search approach and is going more semantic in implementing their knowledge graph. And these are just a few of the prominent examples. The commercial uptake will be a game-changer for the field. It seems that only a fraction of the research results of the past ten years are currently being picked up. It seems that shallow semantics brings added value in many, but not all, application areas. In others it seems that there are roadblocks for which deep semantics is required for added value \u0096 but current approaches are still limited. Linked Data and Big Data are popular buzzwords right now, but could they be hitting a peak on the expectation curve? If so, what is going to happen in the subsequent dive? If not, how will those areas affect the field\u0091s future? In this workshop, we intend to bring together researchers from all corners of the broader Semantic Web community, to share and discuss projections of the way ahead in Semantic Web technologies and knowledge engineering in general.",

These correspondences can be used for various tasks, such as ontology merging, data translation, query answering or navigation on the web of data.

We will then look at the specific tasks involved in mining sentences to extract resource description framework (RDF) triples and show the importance that each level of language analysis can play in such tasks. NLP researchers have been working on such tasks for many years and have developed many algorithms to perform part-of-speech tagging, parsing, semantic disambiguation, named entity recognition and relation extraction. We will present baseline algorithms for these tasks to show expected results from state-of-the-art research. As many algorithms use machine learning (ML) techniques, we will provide a simple introduction to the aims and general principles behind such techniques and explain why they are so important to the NLP community. We will also explore problems that arise when extracting knowledge from multiple sentences and how that is closely related to concept mapping problems, which are familiar to the semantic web community. Since fully automatic text mining is quite a difficult task, we will emphasize that semi-automatic approaches can be effective and viable solutions for facilitating the RDFization of textual data.",

Their attraction is the possibility of fault-tolerant execution and elastic scaling up or down of resources based on user requirements with minimal administrative burden to users. The rapid surge in volume of available RDF data has sharpened focus on the issue of large scale processing of RDF, making RDF query processing in the cloud an important topic. RDF data processing in the cloud requires considerations about appropriate storage models and computing environments and the impact of their underlying assumptions on RDF\u0091s schema-last and join-intensive workloads. Some example considerations are the absence of indexes and statistics usually relied on by traditional query optimization techniques and the heavy materialization in runtime execution environments such as Hadoop vs. pipelined execution plans used in traditional data processing systems. This tutorial will cover RDF query processing in the cloud, particularly MapReduce execution platforms such as Hadoop. It will overview the basics of cloud computing and cloud data storage systems, optimization issues and the state-of-the-art in RDF query optimization for cloud systems. It will also discuss future directions and open issues in query optimization for MapReduce environments.",

Today, Web of Data includes different types of knowledge represented in a homogeneous form: sedimentary one (encyclopedic, cultural, linguistic, common-sense) and real-time one (news, data streams, ...). This data might be useful to interlink diverse information about users, items, and their relations and implement reasoning mechanisms that can support and improve the recommendation process.  The challenge is to investigate whether and how this large amount of wide-coverage and linked semantic knowledge can be automatically introduced into systems that perform tasks requiring human-level intelligence. Examples of such tasks include understanding a health problem in order to make a medical decision, or simply deciding which laptop to buy. Recommender systems support users exactly in those complex tasks.  The primary goal of the workshop is to showcase cutting edge research on the intersection of Semantic Technologies and Recommender Systems, by taking the best of the two worlds. This combination may provide the Semantic Web community with important real-world scenarios where its potential can be effectively exploited into systems performing complex tasks.",

The workshops are concerned with research questions on how current Semantic Web infrastructure can and should be extended to support this vision. Ontologies and linked data vocabularies are defined often in one language only (English), with a biased semantics and a corresponding world view. An infrastructure should be in place for defining ontologies and vocabularies in multiple languages with a transparent semantics across them. Current Semantic Web representation languages (RDF, OWL, SKOS) are limited in regard of the representation of natural language semantics, leaving much of the semantics hidden in textual web content out of scope for the developing Web of Data. NLP and machine learning for Linked Data can benefit from exploiting linguistic resources such as annotated corpora, Wordnets etc. if they are themselves formally represented and linked by use of Linked Data principles. In addressing such research questions, the workshop aims at providing a forum for researchers at the intersection of NLP, multilingual information access, Linked Data and the Semantic Web to exchange ideas on realizing the Multilingual Semantic Web.",

The fundamental data structure of Linked Data is a graph. Graphs are also ubiquitous in many other fields of application, such as social networks, bioinformatics or the World Wide Web. Recently, tensor factorizations have emerged as a highly promising approach to machine learning on graph-structured data, showing both scalability and excellent results on benchmark data sets, while matching perfectly to the triple structure of RDF. This tutorial will provide an introduction to tensor factorizations and their applications for machine learning on graphs. By the means of concrete tasks such as link prediction we will discuss several factorization methods in-depth and also provide necessary theoretical background on tensors in general. Emphasis is put on tensor models that are of interest to Linked Data, which will include models that are able to factorize large-scale graphs with millions of entities and known facts or models that can handle the open-world assumption of Linked Data. Furthermore, we will discuss tensor models for temporal and sequential graph data, e.g. to analyze social networks over time.",

Recent progress includes major initial industry standards from W3C and OMG, and fundamental advances in the underlying knowledge representation techniques in declarative logic programs, including most recently for efficient higher-order defaults with sound integration of first order logic ontologies (OWL). Recent progress also includes methods to use rules for, or with, more expressive OWL ontologies; increasing integration of rules with query /search in SPARQL and relational databases; substantive translations between heterogeneous types of commercial rule engines; development of open-source tools for inferencing and interoperability; performance benchmarking of rule systems; a wide range of emerging applications including in business, science, and trust; and accelerating industry investments / acquisitions in the technology including by integrated software companies such as Oracle, IBM, and Microsoft. This tutorial will provide a comprehensive and up-to-date introduction to these developments and to the fundamentals of the key technologies and outstanding research issues involved. It will explore example application scenarios, overall requirements and challenges, and touch upon business /social value and strategy considerations.",

The workshop focuses on analysis of trends and change in formal descriptions, but also in associated raw sources of knowledge (scientific publications, unstructured or semi-structured Web content, traditional data stores, e-mail or on-line discussion threads, etc.). We are especially interested in research targeted on various states of knowledge evolution, such as (a) conflicts, (b) consolidation, (c) discovery, (d) paradigm shifts, and (e) breakthroughs. We would like to trigger a comprehensive and coherent approach to studying the process of knowledge evolution by bringing together researchers and practitioners from the following fields: (i) Data mining and knowledge discovery in dynamic resources; (ii) Ontology dynamics and versioning; (iii) Trend analysis (in multiple applications, including internet search, corpus evaluation, etc.); (iv) Natural Language Processing (evolution of terminology, language use, semantics); (v) Knowledge Representation (temporal ontologies, temporal logics, belief revision, etc.); (vi) Discourse Analysis and Philosophy of Science (the definition and understanding of what particular phases of the knowledge evolution are, and how can we delimit, identify or even trigger them).",

In addition to material produced by professionals (e.g., maps), the public has also been encouraged to make geospatial content, including their geographical location and a record of their outdoor activities, available online. The volume of such user- generated geospatial content is constantly growing. Similarly, the amount of data extracted from the Web and published as Linked Open Data is increasing. Linked Open Data include many data sets with geospatial properties such as coordinates, feature class or topological relations. The geo-referencing of Web resources and users has given rise to various services and applications that exploit it. With the location of users being made available widely, new issues such as those pertaining to security and privacy arise. Likewise, emergency response, context sensitive user applications, and complex GIS tasks all lend themselves toward solutions that combine both the Geospatial Web and the Semantic Web. The workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners from various disciplines, as well as interested parties from industry and government, to advance the frontiers of this exciting research area.",

Because of this avalanche of data, it is increasingly hard to validate, reproduce, reuse and leverage scientific data. In addition, although publications, methods and datasets are very related, they are not easily accessible and interlinked. The notable exception is omics research where journals require deposit of sequences in databanks as a condition of publication. Even where data is discoverable and accessible, significant challenges remain in data reuse and sharing, in facilitating the necessary correlation, integration and synthesis of data across levels of theory, techniques and disciplines. In the 2nd International Workshop on Linked Science (LISC2012) we will discuss and present results of new ways of publishing, sharing and linking scientific data together, and reasoning over such data to discover interesting new links to validate research. The theme of this year\u0092s workshop will focus on research addressing these issues with respect to big data. Big Data is loosely characterized by the size and/or number of individual files, the number of represented variables, a range of physical scales, a range of scientific disciplines, heterogeneous metadata and data formats, in short data that cannot easily be accessed and manipulated from a thumb-drive.",

Current approaches lack methods for seamless integration of Linked Data from multiple sources, dynamic discovery of available data and data sources, provenance and information quality assessment, application development environments, and appropriate end user interfaces. Addressing these issues requires well-founded research, including the development and investigation of concepts that can be applied in systems which consume Linked Data from the Web. Following the success of the 1st and the 2nd International Workshop on Consuming Linked Data, we organize the third edition of this workshop in order to provide a platform for discussion and work on these open research problems. The main objective is to provide a venue for scientific discourse \u0096 including systematic analysis and rigorous evaluation \u0096 of concepts, algorithms and approaches for consuming Linked Data.",

Four-billion people currently have no access to such an infrastructure and are thus deprived of the benefits Linked (Open) Data provides. This tutorial will show how the design principles and technologies of Linked Data can be adapted to distributed networks, and thus contribute to closing this \u0093digital data divide\u0094.

                            "abstract": "One part of this workshop (LHD) is designed to bring together people from different fields working in the area of dynamic matching, interpretation, and integration of heterogeneous data, so that ideas, techniques and problems can be shared and discussed in a broad context. A key part of this workshop is bringing together those from industry and government as well as those from academia. In order to interact successfully in an open and heterogeneous environment, being able to dynamically and adaptively integrate data from other systems \u0093on the go\u0094 is necessary. This may not be a precise process but a matter of finding a good enough understanding to allow interaction to proceed successfully. With the advent of the Web, there are massive amounts of information available online that can assist in this task, but this information is often chaotically organised, stored in a wide variety of data-formats, and difficult to interpret. The other part of this workshop (SemQuant) aims to unlock a new paradigm in Semantic Web research, and even in KR research in general, by adding a quantitative research paradigm to the traditionally predominant qualitative logic-based paradigm. This is motivated in part by the significant growth in Semantic Web data, including ontologies and Linked Data, over recent years. To efficiently manage the vast quantities of knowledge and data on the Semantic Web, we need theories and tools to address questions like: How can we measure knowledge? How are these measurements different from measurements of information? How can we efficiently store knowledge? How can we efficiently and accurately transform knowledge on noisy channels like the Web? How can we measure the quality of ontologies and other forms of knowledge? How can we determine the quality of approximate methods for inference, similarity, soundness, completeness, etc.? How can such quantitative formalization help the engineering and realization of the Semantic Web?",

In order to promote the widespread publication of provenance information on the Web, the W3C is producing the W3C PROV set of specifications. These specifications provide a basis for the common exchange of provenance information on the Web. This half- day tutorial provides you with an indepth dive into these specifications including handson information on how to publish, query and access provenance information. You will learn how to model your provenance data using the PROV data model and ontology, how to produce provenance information that enables integrity checking and inferences, as well as how to expose and acquire provenance information using PROV access mechanisms and services.",

Although semantic technologies have been recognized as one of very important enablers for this type of applications, there are still several challenges to be resolved in order to apply them in real-world applications. Two most important challenges are: an expressive query language that enables the description of complex situations to be detected (considering real-time and historical data) and an efficient asynchronous retrieval mechanism for the large distributed data streams. Beside elaborating on the importance of these challenges for the real-time aware applications, in this tutorial we give an overview of existing approaches for the semantic processing of real-time streams and present a novel approach based on the recent development in two emerging research areas, Complex Event Processing, that enables an efficient in memory processing of huge real-time data and Cloud Computing, that supports an elastic storage of enormous data volumes. Two studies will be demonstrated: We will show conceptual and technical details of the public-available Platform PLAY, that realizes presented approach. We will demonstrate its usage through two applications that combine real-time events coming from Smartphone (geo position, incoming /outgoing /missing calls), Social media (Facebook wall updates and recent tweets) and real-time sensors. The approach for writing semantic adapters for new event sources and semantic patterns to be detected in event streams will be introduced.",

The goal is to help attendees to turn the sketches into successful submissions and avoid common stumbling blocks. People who wish to participate will be asked to submit a paper sketch (see cfp). The accepted sketeches will be read by the editors and the other chosen participants prior the workshop. Prior to the workshop, participants whose sketches have been accepted to will receive one to three other sketches to read and review. During the workshop, participants will meet in small groups which includes an editorial board memeber. During this discussion, participants will receive specific feedback on on the possible issues to address in order to turn the sketch into a possibly successful submission. Selection for the Journal Workshop session is competitive. Papers currently under review or revision are excluded.",

When the Semantic Web community started working over a decade ago the main question was where to get the data from. By now the question of how to process ever increasing amount of semantic/linked data has come to people's utmost attention. The goal of this panel is to shed light on the various approaches/options for Big Graph Data processing. Possible questions include: (1)Does the Semantic Web need any central infrastructures? (It's a Web, after all?) (2)Or will a handful of large single-owner infrastructures dominate the Semantic Web, just as they now dominate the current Web? (3)And if so, will such infrastructures be based on the standard relational model? (4)Or on MapReduce-centric key/value-pairs? (5)Is Google's (centralised) Knowledge Graph anathema to the Semantic *Web* ? (6)Are triplestore vendors just reinventing the old database wheels? (7)What is the role of clustered MapReduce-like solutions and where are their limits for processing semantic web data?",

Having survived the AI Winter of the 1980s, the opportunities that they saw in the largest, most interconnected computing platform imaginable were obviously compelling.  With the subsequent success of the Semantic Web, however, our community seems to have stopped talking about many of the issues that researchers believe led to the AI Winter in the first place: the cognitive challenges in debugging and maintaining complex systems, the drift in the meanings ascribed to symbols, the situated nature of knowledge, the fundamental difficulty of creating robust models.  These challenges are still with us; we cannot wish them away with appeals to the open-world assumption or to the law of large numbers.  Embracing these challenges will allow us to expand the scope of our science and our practice, and will help to bring us closer to the ultimate vision of the Semantic Web.",
